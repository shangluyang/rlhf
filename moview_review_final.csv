Can you tell me about a film you watched and didn't find particularly engaging or thrilling?,"I got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it. It had a 7,8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and some external comments were pleasant. But I have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out. It starts well, but although it not bored me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal, that I didn't like it very much.<br /><br />You can make a few laughs. And you can see some little tits. But if you like the kind of giallos I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsenseful, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for the good directing and editing, and the final twists, that make the film entertaining. But it could be much better.","The movie had good cinematography and directing, but the story was uninteresting and lacked the bizarre and brutal elements typical of giallo films. The film failed to evoke fear and the events felt mundane. Despite some comedic moments and nudity, the overall experience was underwhelming for fans of more unconventional giallos. A rating of 4 was given for the decent direction, editing, and surprising twists that added some entertainment value, but it fell short of its potential."
Does this movie contain inappropriate themes for children?,"This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes, as a family movie should, and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing. Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie, then maybe it would be better. Hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. There's really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do other than watch this movie, please proceed to them.","This movie falls short in delivering positive messages and appropriate content for kids, making it unsuitable for family viewing. The presence of sexual themes detracts from the overall experience and contributes to the film's negative impact."
"What aspects of the movie ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" received criticism in a review?","with this ABC family attempt of the hit blockbuster ""cheaper by the dozen"" comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue, shallow plot lines, and cheesy comebacks. With about two good actors among many wanna-be's, this movie was a major disappointment. Its a Hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already bad plot. Then, because they needed a lot of actors, that meant that they'd probably be more lenient. So the acting wasn't five-star. The plot moved fairly fast, and the twists were bad and had horrible timing. The junction of characters and the ""end relationships"" were also too mushy and clichéd for me. Spare yourself and rent something better.","The movie was criticized for its corny dialogue, shallow plot lines, cheesy comebacks, lack of strong actors, fast-paced but poorly executed plot, bad twists, mushy and clichéd character relationships, ultimately resulting in a major disappointment and a Hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already bad plot."
What type of audience would enjoy this movie?,"I simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and I hoped it would do: entertain. <br /><br />I wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of Romero or Fulci, but what I rented it for was a laugh. <br /><br />If you are looking for a film for amusement, or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment, go for it. This is perfect for junior- ""Mystery Science Theater"" fans, but the only downside is that it is so bad, it makes fun of itself. <br /><br />I, personally, think it is a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title that we may know, because when a film sucks like this, it has its own genre.","This person gave the movie a three-star rating because it fulfilled his expectation of being entertaining. He clarifies that he didn't have high hopes for it compared to classic zombie films, but found it enjoyable for a good laugh. He suggests that viewers seeking amusement or those who appreciate cheesy, self-mocking films would enjoy it, particularly fans of ""Mystery Science Theater."" However, he also mentions that the film's poor quality makes it hard to compare it to mainstream Hollywood movies."
Did the low budget affect the quality of the film?,"The first mistake you make in titling a film is to use ""of the living dead"" without really having a budget for real zombie FX. Sure, this was a low budget zombie flick - really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects.<br /><br />It was really not too bad considering the above, and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you are going to get an ""R"" for violence, you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked. The women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as ""gay interest.""<br /><br />And, I am staying out of Oakland. There was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight!","The movie ""Of the Living Dead"" suffered from low budget constraints which resulted in amateur actors and unconvincing zombie effects. Despite these limitations, the film did offer a unique twist to the zombie genre and lacked in utilizing female characters effectively. Additionally, the excessive violence and lack of police presence in certain scenes might be off-putting to some viewers."
"What is your opinion on the movie ""Hood of the Living Dead""?","This movie is yet another in the long line of no budget, no effort, no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store.<br /><br />If you want to know what watching this movie is like, grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and ""attacking"" people. Congratulations, you've just made ""Hood of the Living Dead""! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you.<br /><br />I have seen some low budget, shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort, but this has neither. Avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies.","This movie is yet another in the long line of no budget, no effort, no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store.

"What are some drawbacks of the movie ""Hood of the Living Dead"" according to a reviewer?","Hood of the Living Dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video footage is better than this film (although the similarities between them warrant the comparison). ""Hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies!"". Hopefully nobody ELSE wasn't. My apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie.","The reviewer found the acting in the film to be extremely unconvincing and amateurish, stating that it seemed like the actors had no talent and the lines were completely unrehearsed. They compared the movie to home videos and amateur films, suggesting that those would be better than watching this film. Additionally, the reviewer expressed disappointment in the quality of the movie, feeling deceived by fake reviews they had read before purchasing it."
What were some major flaws in the movie that negatively impacted the viewer's experience?,"It was a painful experience, the whole story is actually there so I won't go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work, I thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn't even tell him anything about it...not to mentioned bad acting very bad can't get any worst than that my advice don't watch and I thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently Uwi Boll's movies look like classical Shakespeare compared to this!","The movie featured cringe-worthy acting, sloppy attention to detail in setting and props, unrealistic depiction of a scientific lab, and poor character decisions that made it hard to take seriously."
"What are some key criticisms of the movie ""The Re-Animator""?",This movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by. His brother then infects the other gang members.In some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense. The acting is mediocre but the story doesn't help the film. The makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies. The budget for this film I'm sure was very limited. I believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget. If you wan't to see a good zombie flick don't see this one.,"This movie was a complete disaster from the start. The storyline was predictable and cliche, the special effects were laughable, and the acting was so wooden I felt like I was watching a high school play. I honestly don't know how this film even made it to the big screen. If you're looking for a well-made, engaging movie, definitely skip this one."
What is the premise of the movie and why is it considered ridiculous?,"From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge. Supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only similarity it bears to anything Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (albeit an Africa that has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes!), and has some characters with the same names.<br /><br />Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to seek treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up precisely where the treasure is, purely by chance. On the way, they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters, pick up a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phoenicia.<br /><br />It's so ridiculous, it's a hoot. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 1.","The movie, supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, lacks any true resemblance to his writings other than taking place in Africa and sharing some character names. The plot involves characters journeying to find treasure with absurd scenes like using dinosaurs to pull canoes. The storyline is illogical and far-fetched, with encounters with ridiculous monsters and a random affair subplot with the Queen of Phoenicia leading to a nonsensical mess. The only redeeming quality is its unintentional hilarity."
What are some criticisms of the movie?,"Man, was I disappointed.<br /><br />1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /><br />2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateurish script.<br /><br />3) The movie suffers from horrible pacing. It jumps around through in a jumbled, confusing manner.<br /><br />4) The story doesn't even make sense. Why does he want to break the football streak? What about the stupid violin music? None of it is explained.<br /><br />5) It's not even funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv, saying ""Lookit me! Lookit me I'm being funny!"" This was a bad attempt at making another ""Love At First Bite"".<br /><br />I like Larry Cohen movies, but man he failed here. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. Horribly disappointed.","The movie was a huge disappointment for many viewers. The character played by Adam Arkin was overly whiny, reminiscent of Ross Geller from 'Friends'. Despite having a talented cast including Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, and Louis Nye, they were all let down by a weak script. The pacing of the movie was terrible, jumping around in a confusing manner. The story lacked coherence and failed to explain pivotal elements like the protagonist's motivation to break the football streak or the significance of the violin music. The attempts at humor fell flat, making it seem like a forced comedy rather than a genuine one. Overall, this movie was a disappointing attempt at emulating the success of ""Love At First Bite"", leaving many viewers eagerly awaiting the end credits."
What did you find disappointing about the movie?,Whack!!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end. Other than that I was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time. Some teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his Dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there's a full moon. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her. This movie sucked and I don't recommend it to anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Only Ms. Hartman did a great job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one!!,"The movie was a huge letdown due to the minimal screen time of Elizabeth Hartman and the lackluster plot that was filled with predictable and uninteresting scenes. Despite a promising premise of a teenager turning into a werewolf, the execution was poor and had viewers wishing they had chosen to read a book like War and Peace instead."
"What are some redeeming qualities of ""Full Moon High""?","I've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time, this one however, takes the cake. More comedy than horror, ""Full Moon High"" puts the ""c"" in cheese-fest. The star quality in this movie is not bad. Just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, an all-American high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. He drove everyone batty! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own bullet. Adam's father Alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game. After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack, and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state. More laugh than blood shed, this movie is just a start in the 80's, ""Teen Wolf"" was an improvement from this! 1 out of 5 stars.","The movie ""Full Moon High"" is unimpressive as a teenage werewolf film with more comedy than horror. It comes off as a cheesy production with subpar execution. The character portrayals are lackluster and fail to engage the audience. The comedic elements are forced and fall flat, making the overall viewing experience rather dull and uninteresting. The plot lacks depth and fails to create any suspense or intrigue, leaving viewers underwhelmed and unsatisfied. Overall, ""Full Moon High"" fails to deliver on its potential and pales in comparison to other movies in its genre."
"Could this movie be considered a comeback for the director of ""Don't Look Now"" and ""Bad Timing""?","Could this be by the same director as Don't Look Now or Bad Timing? Poorly<br /><br />acted, clunkily edited. You only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in Don't Look Now to see how much Roeg has lost his<br /><br />touch.<br /><br />Even the generally reliable Teresa Russell (looking a bit chunky these days, I'm afraid to report) cannot save this one. The plot is pure pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is wooden and Roeg's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful.<br /><br />Avoid this one like the plague.","This movie was poorly acted and clunkily edited. The director seems to have lost his touch as seen in the comparisons with his previous works. Even the usually reliable Teresa Russell couldn't salvage the film. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is stiff, and the attempts at creating a unique time structure fall flat. It's best to steer clear of this movie."
"Would you recommend this movie to someone looking for a serious, plot-driven film experience?","This movie was strange... I watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. Im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high, but mushrooms weren't enough. I couldn't stop laughing.. maybe lsd would work. The movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things, and dancing. Its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit, pop it on you'll get a few laughs.","This movie may come off as bizarre and nonsensical to viewers looking for a coherent storyline. The over-the-top visuals and lack of substantial plot may leave some audience members feeling confused and unengaged. It seems like the film relies heavily on psychedelic substances to enhance the viewing experience, which might not resonate well with those seeking a more traditional narrative."
"Can you identify some key differences between the movie ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" and the original book by Tom Robbins?","I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.",
What makes this movie so disappointing and why wouldn't you recommend it?,"I couldn't believe how lame & pointless this was. Basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie, hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie. This movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must've taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple & humble. Luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons. I won't write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across America because of her huge thumb. I would give this movie a 2 / 10. Before I watched this movie I was wondering why this movie has only got a 4.0/10, & now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Don't buy it even if you see it for under $5.","The movie was incredibly boring and lacked any spark that could keep the audience engaged. The humor fell flat, the plot failed to captivate, and even with big-name stars like Keanu Reeves and Uma Thurman, their talents were completely wasted. Reeves seemed to lack the acting skills he later showcased in The Matrix, and Thurman appeared plain and unremarkable. The story was forgettable, to say the least, with little to no intrigue. Overall, this film is a complete letdown and not worth the cheap price it may be offered at. It's clear why this movie has such a low rating, and I would strongly advise against spending any money on it."
What were some major drawbacks of the movie?,"I watched this film because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give their sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I regret checking it out. She was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Have Sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. I thought she was everything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHATS THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. Hopefully, Rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I wouldnt do much better with that film.","The movie was a complete disappointment with a weird and unsatisfying plot. The characters were portrayed in a bizarre and embarrassing manner, particularly Rain Phoenix's performance was underwhelming. The storyline involving characters sleeping with an old man in the mountains was off-putting and made little sense. The film seemed like a waste of resources with no redeeming qualities, earning a 0 out of 10 rating."
What made this movie one of the most disappointing experiences for the reviewer?,"This is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. Cool title, excellent director (I saw ""To Die For"" and ""Drugstore Cowboy"" before this), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched this turkey.<br /><br />Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. Its critical lambasting was well deserved. You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality. Zero out of ****.","The movie is described as disjointed, unfunny, and a dead-zone that lacks any redeeming qualities. The reviewer suggests avoiding it at all costs and believes it deserved the critical lambasting it received."
What makes this movie stand out from other films starring Uma Thurman?,"i'll admit. i think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in (unfortunately that includes the horrible films Batman and robin, The Avengers) and this one.<br /><br />this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen. (yes it ranks even lower than The Avengers). everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief. <br /><br />even if you think Uma is a goddess like i do, PLEASE PLEASE don't subject yourself to this movie. you'll hate yourself the following morning for it.","This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is confusing, the characters seem directionless, and the overall coherence of the film is nonexistent. Even if you're a fan of Uma Thurman, it's best to steer clear of this one to avoid a major disappointment."
Can you explain the reason for this kind of film?,"Why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap? My god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it. I can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it. Also, there is apparently some controversy as to whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was uncredited but his list of roles here (IMDB) does give him credit. BTW... Rain is his sister for those who have were asking before. This film is proof that no matter how many big ""names"" you have. Sow's ears don't make silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco but this was just sad, sad, sad... Maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film. It has no endearing, entertaining, or even comedic properties in comparison to it's bad everything else.","Why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap?

What is the main premise of the movie?,"George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress. She is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune. He interviews her on her yacht. They fall for each other in bathing costumes.<br /><br />It turns out (quite early) that she is not an heiress. She part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream.<br /><br />The movie follows the ups and downs of their romance.<br /><br />The supporting cast does little to buoy it up. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Though it's fairly predictable, it is also fairly entertaining. It's far from her best. But, especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre, it's not one of her worst, either.","George Brent plays a reporter tasked with interviewing a woman believed to be an heiress to a face cream fortune, only to discover she's part of an advertising campaign. The film focuses on their romance, with Bette Davis and Brent carrying the story. While it's predictable, it remains fairly entertaining, though the supporting cast doesn't add much to the movie."
What are some of the issues mentioned in this review?,"I'm not a huge Freddy Krueger fan,but that doesn't mean that I don't like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies.I think that Robert is a very good actor.Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than he does.But,no offense Robert, this movie sucked.The acting is terrible,the plot is really weak,and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that's even worth watching.Sometimes sequels can be better than the first,such as the Friday the 13th franchise(I thought the remake was the best in the series.)But this isn't one of those movies.The original was good,the 2nd in my opinion was better,the 3rd was okay but I haven,t seen the others.Whatever you do,don,t make the same mistake I did by watching this piece of crap.","The reviewer criticizes the acting, weak plot, and overall quality of the movie, stating that only Freddy Krueger's character is worth watching. They express disappointment in the movie and advise against watching it."
Can you please provide a negative review of this movie?,"This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I feel better. This movie is poor from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is at his cartoon character worst. Thank God they killed him off. And who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold cameos?<br /><br />The only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on Freddy. We see he once had a family, and we get to see his abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper).<br /><br />Other than that, all bad. There are some quality actors in here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just so bad. The hour and a half I spent watching this movie is and hour and half I can't ever get back.","This movie is a complete disaster. From the weak storyline to the terrible 3-D effects and over-the-top cartoonish portrayal of Freddy, everything about this film falls flat. The cameos by Roseanne and Tom Arnold only add to the cringeworthy moments. The only saving grace is a small glimpse into Freddy's past, but that alone cannot salvage this mess. Despite having talented actors like Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto, their efforts are overshadowed by the overall poor quality of the movie. Watching this film is a complete waste of time that you can never get back."
"What makes ""Freddy's Dead"" stand out from the previous film in the franchise?","""Freddy's Dead"" did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this ""final"" film in the saga is silly but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even a bit breath-taking. And the story of Freddy's kid (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater. It has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic-trick, and, in the end, it's nothing but goofy, childish entertainment.<br /><br />","Despite being original and visually pleasing, ""Freddy's Dead"" falls short with its silly and cartoonish approach. The talented actors in the movie seem unimpressive, leading to a lackluster and childish form of entertainment."
What were some aspects of the film that the reviewer found ridiculous and unsatisfactory?,"This movie was just terrible, the first movie wasn't that great i mean it's ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one, why just not make this into an ongoing series like James Bond, i'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink, i don't understand, was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn't be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror, a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film. Please no more of these movies.","The film was described as terrible and ridiculously stupid. The reviewer mentioned a lack of quality compared to successful film series like James Bond, criticizing the attempt to blend horror and comedy resulting in a failed attempt at scaring the audience. The reviewer expressed disappointment and a strong dislike for the movie and expressed a desire for no more sequels."
"Can you describe the faults of ""Freddy's Dead""?","This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down, but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that ""Freddy's Dead"" is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. The horrible 3-D ending and over-the-top CORNY kills are enough to drive this ""film"" into the ground. However, it doesn't stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that. This is a strictly fans only movie, don't stare at our shame.","""Freddy's Dead"" is deemed as an atrocious addition to the Nightmare series, a movie filled with boredom, lack of purpose, and minimal suspense. The 3-D conclusion and exaggeratedly cheesy killings contribute significantly to its downfall. The subpar acting, poor screenplay, and cringeworthy cameos further cement this film as a failure, leading many to consider it one of the worst horror sequels ever made. Overall, ""Freddy's Dead"" is a disappointment for both casual viewers and die-hard fans of the franchise."
What were some major flaws in the movie?,"It WAS supposed to be the last Freddy movie (and it was for over 10 years)--you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done. But they turned out giving us the worst of the series (and that's saying a lot). The plot made no sense (I seriously can't remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them dead) and Freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual. The only remotely good bit about this was a brief (and funny) cameo by Johnny Depp (the first ""Nightmare"" movie was his first).<br /><br />Also I originally saw it in a theatre were the last section (reaccounting Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well--the 3-D was lousy--faded colors and the image going in and out of focus. Also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. EVERYBODY broke down laughing. Looks even worse on TV in 2-D. Pointless and stupid--very dull also. Skip this one and see ""Freddy vs. Jason"" again.","The plot in this supposed final installment of the Freddy series was nonsensical, the main characters were unlikeable, and Freddy's humor fell flat. The 3-D effects were poorly executed, with faded colors and blurry images, resulting in unintentional laughter from the audience. Overall, the movie was deemed pointless, stupid, and very dull. It's advised to skip this film and revisit ""Freddy vs. Jason"" instead."
What are some aspects of the movie that were criticized in the review?,"In the future of 2001, Freddy is after the last surviving teenager of Elm Street. Forsaking ANY scares whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and needless celebrity cameos (come on..Roseanne??? Tom Arnold??!!?? WTF?), this is tied with part 2 is the worst the demon child rapist ever got. Wow was this a piece of crap. Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could make the stench of this movie go away. And when they hell did Freddy ever have a daughter?? The whole film is severely retarded in ever single conceivable way, shape & form. Rachel Talalay, you stink to high heaven, babe.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Cast and Crew Bios; Jump to the 3D sequence and Jump to a Nightmare options (more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set) <br /><br />DVD-Rom content: Trivia game; Screenplay; and web link","The reviewer disliked the lack of scares and humor, unnecessary celebrity cameos, including Roseanne and Tom Arnold, and the overall poor execution of the film. The addition of a daughter for Freddy Krueger was also criticized, along with the director Rachel Talalay. The reviewer gave the movie a low grade of D- and emphasized its numerous flaws."
What was the main highlight of the film that made it enjoyable to watch?,"The film was made in 1942 and with World War 11 around, the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around.<br /><br />The film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of Eleanor Powell. The late Miss Powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young looking Red Skelton here. The two of them also starred in ""I Dood It.""<br /><br />Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later, was superb as the interrogating police officer in ""Mildred Pierce"" again appears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item. Trouble is that Olsen and his rogues are really the Japanese spies.<br /><br />Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from Virginia O'Brien.",The film was a product of using the World War 11 background to create a spy-themed storyline that engaged the audience. The fabulous dancing of Eleanor Powell and the chemistry between her and Red Skelton added a fun element to the movie. Bert Lahr's brilliant performance and the support from Virginia O'Brien further enhanced the viewing experience.
"Did the movie ""Page 3"" receive any positive reception anywhere in the world?","Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past. His next film Page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time. It apparently tells the story of some high class people in India. After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidently i did. The reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing stuff, there was no need to show the children fully naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people, British men in this movie. I am shocked to know this film was a Hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in UK, USA and Australia. I'm from UK, and this kind of stuff makes me sick, shouldn't of been released in UK.","The movie ""Page 3"" by Madhur Bhandarkar has been criticized for its disturbing and inappropriate portrayal of child pornography and molestation. The scenes showing naked children were deemed unnecessary and revolting, leading to a sense of shock and nausea among viewers. The movie's depiction of rich individuals kidnapping and selling poor children to foreign buyers, specifically British men, added to the unsettling nature of the film. Despite being a hit in parts of India, ""Page 3"" flopped in the UK, USA, and Australia due to its controversial content, which was deemed unacceptable by viewers in those regions. The film's themes and scenes made some audiences physically ill and were deemed highly disturbing and offensive."
What is the overall theme and message of Madhur Bhandarkar's movie Page 3?,"Crude, some times crass - to me that's the summation of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. He has no point of view - just shallow, funny digs at stereotypes. What is the movie about?? Is it about reporting a clan of people (so called Page 3 types) who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else. And you are either in it or out of it. Is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and Page 3 is just a supplement; perhaps an entertainer for checking out who's who and what's what. Don't mix the two. And then there is power play - that would happen in every walk of life. So what have you told at the end of it all - nothing - just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie.","The movie fails to deliver a clear perspective or meaningful narrative, relying instead on superficial humor and stereotypes. It lacks a focused point of view and ends up feeling directionless, with crude jokes being the main highlight."
Can you tell me more positive reviews about the movie?,"I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show. The acting was ham-fisted and amateur, the story was old news, and plot development (or lack thereof) invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode. That's about all there is to say of it, because it genuinely lacked substance of any kind.<br /><br />How can you people like crap like this? It's freaking stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I don't even know how to further explain it... It's as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look, or because, for whatever crazy reason, you haven't seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before.<br /><br />I just.. forget it. This show sucked, and thankfully it's gone forever. I wish they'd get to work on demolishing The O.C. once and for all.",
What elements of the show did the reviewer find entertaining despite its flaws?,"This show was laughably bad. The writing sucked, the dialog sucked. The guy who played Craig couldn't act his way out of a paper sack. Being it was on Thursday night, this was definitely great to watch with some beers. Cool music, bad acting, poor writing, all came together for my entertainment.<br /><br />It was a drama/unintentional comedy. I don't care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they couldn't reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialog around it, which was terrible. I mean, the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible.<br /><br />So, let's review. Everything happening in present time sucked. The flashback scenes, only the writing, dialog and Craig's acting sucked. The music ruled though.","The reviewer emphasized how the writing, dialog, and acting were subpar in the show, particularly in the present-time scenes. The characters were labeled as boring and stupid, with the reviewer finding the first five episodes to be particularly weak due to the writing constraints. The only redeeming quality highlighted was the music, making the flashback scenes somewhat bearable."
What are some criticisms of the movie that you have heard?,"Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first starring role, shows her real-life rebellious nature in this slow-moving feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme Liberalism or what?<br /><br />Being a staunch feminist in real life, she must have cherished this script. No wonder Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; it's right up his political alley, too.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained, not preached the heavy-handed Liberal agenda.","The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed feminist and liberal themes in the film, suggesting that it prioritizes political correctness over entertainment value. They believe that Ashley Judd's performance is overshadowed by the preachy nature of the storyline."
"What was your overall impression of the film ""Written on The Wind""?","I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson,Lauren Becall,Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was terrible- just bloody horrible- he was supposed to be a charming jet-setting millionaire- instead he came off like a jerk from the word go- the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 ""romantic"" leads had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring- think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on Get Smart",
What do you think makes this movie not worth watching?,"I don't know what would be so great about this movie. Even worse, why should anyone bother seeing this one ? First of all there is no story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />You are just watching images for +/- 2 hrs. There are more useful things to do.<br /><br />I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above. But is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money ? For me the answer is: no.","The movie lacks a story and fails to evoke any strong emotions, leaving the viewer watching images for two hours without any real value. It comes across as more of an experimental and daring attempt but ultimately fails to justify the time and money spent on it."
What elements of the movie failed to come together cohesively?,"This whirling movie looks more like a combination of music-clips at MTV than as a real movie. There is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself: ""What is going to happen?""; but nothing happens. The story around Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other persons seem to have nothing in common: then why bring them together in a movie. With music you can make watchable the worst movie. When I open the tap and there comes water out with the music of Bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie. The director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie.",The lack of a convincing storyline and disparate characters made it difficult to fully engage with the movie. The director's focus on style over substance resulted in a visually appealing yet ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience.
Did the movie fail to create a cohesive storyline?,"How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better Flemish movie ""Congo Express (1986)""? There are also some characters in congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other: Jean, (de Congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great Flemish movie ""De Witte (1934)"" where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres. Another missed chance for Flemish Cinema.","Despite featuring a star like Tom Barman, ""Anyway the Wind Blows"" falls short in establishing a clear connection between its characters, resulting in a disjointed and confusing narrative. The lack of explanations for certain events and borrowed jokes from other films make it feel like more of a TV experiment rather than a theater-worthy movie. A missed opportunity for Flemish Cinema."
Can you describe the movie in more detail?,"I dunno what the hype around this is... This is really a bad movie...it did nothing to me, the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party, and a nice song is playing, uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move....that was the best part of the movie... Otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in There's no story, there's nothing to think about like some people say, there's no cohesion between the different stories...it was more of an attempt to re-do Anderson's 'Magnolia' which was brilliant, but it fails blatantly... Okay it's light and easy to watch, but that are movieclips too. Maybe first write a story before you make a movie... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've seen","This movie did not live up to its hype at all. The only decent part was a scene at a party with a good song playing. Overall, the film lacks a compelling story and fails to engage the viewer. It feels like a poor imitation of a better film. I would give it a 4 out of 10 and consider it one of the worst Belgian movies I've seen."
What makes this film's attempt at mimicking classic film noir fall short?,"A film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title, ""Farewell My Lovely"", thinking the gullible would assume it a remake. The characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released. Time only adds to it its absurdity. Having none of the guile, cinematography, desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours. As if that weren't enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn't bothered to bathe in several days. This only made this mess all the more painful to watch. Find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure.","The film's attempt to emulate classic film noir is a complete failure due to its unappealing and foul characters, lack of guile and despair, convoluted crime plot, and a feeble attempt at erotica which only adds to its absurdity. It is a painful mess to watch and not worth the time."
What makes the film lack purpose and fail to keep the audience engaged?,"What was the purpose of this film? I suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie. A braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives. He starts out as a fix-it man for the woman, and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme. It was so confusing I can't even write a decent critique. If you see this one, my sweet, make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep.","Despite having talented actors like Bruce Dern, the film is boring and confusing, with a storyline that fails to capture interest and leaves viewers struggling to even critique it. The plot follows a braindead ex-pugilist who gets involved in a kidnapping scheme after falling in with a strange woman and her relatives, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience that may just lull you to sleep if watched after dark."
Can you tell me about a movie that you absolutely hated?,"Dr Mordrid is terrifying. I would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already. There is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against a backdrop of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing. I rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix. That movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. That is where this movie belongs. I suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment, go and rent All Dogs Go To Heaven, or Angels In The Outfield. Those movies are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies, you need to see Dr. Mordrid.","Dr Mordrid is truly a nightmare to sit through. The level of filth in this film is unbearable, with twisted imagery that I can only describe as demonic. It's so bad that I went to extreme lengths to make sure no one else would have to endure it by destroying every copy I could find. This movie should be banished to the depths of hell where it belongs. If you're looking for a movie to watch, steer clear of Dr. Mordrid and opt for something more wholesome like All Dogs Go To Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. Trust me, watching this film is a sin in itself."
What are some of the issues with Scanners 2 according to the reviewer?,"the first Scanners may not have been a great movie,but at least it was original.there is no such novelty to this one.the acting is worse,in my opinion,and the story is slower and nothing special.i also didn't like the dialogue.and the special effects are no better than in the original.this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways.the only thing different about it,is that it is loud and chaotic at times.but that doesn't make a good movie.if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting,this could have been a decent movie.i actually couldn't get through it all without fast forwarding through it.to me,this is a forgettable movie,and not much more.despite all that,there are worse movies.being in a generous mood,i'll give Scanners 2 a 4/10.","The reviewer thought that Scanners 2 lacked originality compared to the first movie. They found the acting to be worse, the story slower and uninteresting, disliked the dialogue, and felt the special effects were not improved. The movie was described as loud and chaotic at times but failed to deliver a compelling narrative. Overall, the reviewer considered Scanners 2 forgettable and gave it a low rating of 4/10."
What did viewers think about the two main roles in the movie?,"I agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted, that being the guy that played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. Too bad the story was so boring. Not hearing about the story I knew nothing of Gary Gillmore before the movie so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber but how wrong I was. The whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about their mom and dad. The only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper. That was the only interest I got from this borefest.","Many viewers found the performances of the actors playing Gary Gillmore and Giovanni to be quite impressive. Unfortunately, the movie was criticized for having a boring story that mainly focused on repetitive discussions about the characters' parents. The lack of exciting elements and excessive dialogue made it a dull watch for many."
What are the key elements that make this movie fall short of expectations?,"Kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets. With the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents. Infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole. It seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is scatter shot, its focus wanders more than a Chihuahua with ADD on quadruple espresso. I kept asking ""What am I watching"". I watched it from start to finish and I still don't know what the hell happened. Its a shame since there are some great action scenes, some amusing jokes and the occasional moment, but nothing, none of it ever comes together, I'd take a pass.","The movie attempts to blend action and comedy but ends up feeling disorganized and confusing. Despite some good action scenes and jokes, the overall presentation lacks coherence and fails to engage the audience effectively."
What are some aspects of the movie that could have been improved?,"The direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original....however, as to those who have read 'slam dunk' comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes...<br /><br />Another note is Jay Chow himself DO NOT know Kung Fu, it just won't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can, many people today can see the differences.. Luckily the movie do not contain much of KunG Fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects...<br /><br />I think that Jay's acting is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity.<br /><br />Despite how hard I wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this ""orginal"" movie getting what it shouldn't have, it has became one of the best budget films in China for this year.","The direction made it clear that the film's idea and plot were original, but viewers familiar with the 'Slam Dunk' comic would notice striking similarities in the characters and jokes. Additionally, Jay Chow's lack of knowledge in Kung Fu was evident, which made his attempts at action scenes unimpressive. While the movie relied on stunts and visual effects instead of extensive Kung Fu fighting, Jay's acting fell short compared to the rest of the cast, possibly only being cast for his popularity."
What are some aspects of the film that led to disappointment for the reviewer?,"Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty disappointing (but then, I guess my expectations were sky-high). Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film.","The movie was hyped up for its artistic value and cerebral nature, but the reviewer found it underwhelming. The black and white cinematography, while visually striking, did not compensate for the lackluster storyline centered around a conversation between characters examining paintings for clues about a political crime. The film's attempt at depth and complexity fell short, failing to live up to the praise it had garnered."
What stands out the most in this action-packed sci-fi movie?,"Plot Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped & replaced with an android double, Secret Service agent Eric Phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid ""Cyber Tracker"". That film was nothing special, not to mention a blatant rip-off of both ""The Terminator"" & ""RoboCop"". This sequel is the same as before, with an all-out action sequence opening the film. There are plenty of explosions, heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount, as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the film's star, Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson. The whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.","The action sequences are impressive, filled with explosions, gunfire, and martial arts moves by the film's star. However, the plot feels thin, and the lead actor's performance is lackluster, making it hard to stay engaged with the film."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find boring and pretentious?,"This is one of those movies where I wish I had just stayed in the bar.<br /><br />The film is quite frankly boring. What story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it. The film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film. Did I say it was boring already? If all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie I would not have cared less as I had no emotional attachment to any of them.<br /><br />There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but that was about it. This is the first time I have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance, but I held on believing that it had to get better. I was wrong.<br /><br />The sort of film you could threaten naughty children with.","The movie was labeled as boring, with a very flimsy story that was hard to follow. The reviewer criticized the pretentious camera techniques and lack of emotional attachment to the characters."
"Could you recommend a movie with better performances and more engaging dialogue than ""Starstruck""?","This was a truly insipid film. The performances are third rate, and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died. My reason for renting this was simple: Find a movie with scriptwriting. I needed a visual aid for my presentation, so I figured why not use a clip? Boy was I wrong. After searching my local video store, I came upon this, where it was suspiciously titled ""Starstruck"". I thought, ""What the hey"", and decided to give it a try. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. There was maybe one scene I could use, and meanwhile, I was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick. So.....I took this back and picked up Ed Wood. There's a movie I can use as an example. Then again, anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is ""Starfucker"".",
What do you think of the overall coherence and the impact of the film on the audience is?,"I have a high tolerance for the weird, but frankly some movies go way, way beyond weird--so far that they make your brain hurt. This is such a film. Trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and I think the film is best understood while taking drugs--it's that incomprehensible.<br /><br />The film begins with some very cute Japanese animation involving a cat. However, out of the blue, tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur--making me wonder if I am losing something in the translation. However, even if this is so, why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever, defecation, puking, lighting animals on fire, etc.. All this really seemed random and pretty awful. Oddly, and I don't know why, some see this as a work of genius. I just don't get that.","The film seems to lack coherence and can be confusing to follow. It includes random and disturbing imagery that may not sit well with many viewers, somewhat detracting from the overall impact of the movie."
Can you elaborate on the movie's storyline and characters?,"OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting. Then you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes. Supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit I did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending. This movie has the following elements: A battered and abused next door neighbor, a boring legal trial, racisim, talk of lynchings, and death and arson. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you never listen to anyone's reviews, please do here. You cannot even force yourself to watch this crap. CRAP! I said it, CRAP! Whoever put there name on this should indeed sue.","The plot was confusing and the characters lacked depth, making it difficult to connect or care about their struggles."
Can you provide a brief overview of the movie you watched last night with your family and friends?,"I was true to my regard for Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. I watched the entire film with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the movie was about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts.<br /><br />It doesn't hang together very well. It is too choppy, and there is little comedy. I am disappointed. It could have been much better.<br /><br />I waited months to see this film based on the liner notes.<br /><br />Don't waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of Mr. Glover's and Ms. Goldberg's films.<br /><br />It was a poor way to spend an evening.",The movie was a letdown despite featuring well-known actors like Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. The plot was confusing and failed to keep our attention. The lack of humor and choppiness made it disappointing and not worth the wait. It's not recommended unless you are a die-hard fan trying to watch all the works of these actors.
What genre is the movie predominantly classified as?,"I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I didn't. This movie has a VERY hard time following and/or staying to a plot. If someone tells you it's a comedy, don't be fooled, it's about 98% percent odd-drama and 2% comedy. All actors turn in a great performance, that cannot be denied, however it seems like it really lost something somewhere. Don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what. This had potential, and instead it was really a flop. I would really like the hour and a half I invested in this movie back, but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time. Save your money and see something else.","Despite the strong performances by all the actors, the movie struggles to maintain a coherent plot and shifts away from its advertised comedy genre, ultimately disappointing viewers. It feels like the potential of the original script got lost somewhere along the way, resulting in a film that fell short of expectations and left audiences feeling they wasted their time and money."
Can this movie be considered a Hollywood film?,"Well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen. They have tried out these 666 child of Satan the anti Christ kinda movies about 1000 times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them. They think that it's going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood. This movie doesn't have any idea in it, actors and filming is just terrible. Cant even make out that 10 line minium of this movie. Really nothing to tell about but that it's just horrible. How they can make movies like that in their right mind just can't understand that. This cant be a Hollywood movie, is it? Just don't go watch this use your money more wisely.","This movie may just be the worst film I have ever seen. The recycled concept of Satanic children has been done to death, and this film adds nothing new or interesting to the genre. The excessive use of fake blood does not make up for the lack of substance in the story. The acting and filming are poor, making it difficult to even follow the basic plot. Overall, this movie is a complete mess and a waste of time and money."
"What were some of the major flaws that stood out in ""666: The Child"" according to the reviewer?","I was supposed to review this for a website, and I watched this with optimism that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off, and it didn't even do that well enough.<br /><br />""666: The Child"" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (Even worse than ""Godsend"") with scenes that rip from ""The Omen"" without shame. The ending is even very similar to the way ""The Omen"" ends. <br /><br />Not to mention that the acting, writing, and story are all just hackneyed. If these movies make money, I'm sad to see where Asylum is headed. It's embarrassing.","The reviewer found ""666: The Child"" to be one of the worst supernatural thrillers, with unoriginal scenes borrowed shamelessly from ""The Omen"" and a lackluster ending reminiscent of said movie. The acting, writing, and story were described as hackneyed, leading to an overall embarrassing viewing experience."
What are some examples of Asylum movies that the reviewer has enjoyed in the past?,"I actually like Asylum movies. I've made it a habit to see as many as possible. Even the rip-offs they've done have been cool like EXORCISM And WHEN A KILLER CALLS. This is just plain lame. I can't believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE actually made this movie too!!! It's not even laughably bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way are pretty bad). This is just BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and/or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an Asylum movie, but this film takes itself way too seriously. I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. Now that's a movie I can't wait to see.","The reviewer expressed disappointment in this particular movie, stating that it was not even at the level of being humorously bad like some other Asylum movies. They found the film to be just plain bad, highlighting that it took itself too seriously and lacked the charm typically associated with Asylum productions. The reviewer also expressed hope for a different movie, ""Snakes on a Train,"" which they are looking forward to seeing."
What are some notable flaws in the movie?,"Well, it's all been said about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said. But the thing is, I have seen zillions of movies and I am working on writing reviews on all the movies that I've seen. So, I have to write something.<br /><br />The acting is stupid. It's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash. The nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be. Don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. We don't see how the granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die, you just don't sympathize with them. And uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better. We just hear him scream and we see nothing!","The reviewer criticizes the acting in the film, particularly pointing out the portrayal of emotions by the news anchor as ""stupid"". They also mention that the killings in the movie are weak and lack impact, with specific examples of deaths not being shown adequately. The reviewer expresses disappointment in the lack of scare factor, questioning the decisions made by the filmmakers."
What were some aspects of the horror movie that made it a disappointing watch?,"This movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks I've seen. The length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline. Also, the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure, and the dad is shot by a police officer? I can see where some originality might have been what they were going for, but it could have been better. Also, the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over. After hearing all of Lucy's name and figuring out it was 'Lucifer', I wanted to gag. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a male's name. It should be given to a male character. All in all, the movie was a bore, and could have used a better plot.","The movie failed to deliver a compelling storyline due to its short length. The deaths of the foster parents were unrealistic and ridiculous, with the mother dying from falling through the shower after tripping over an action figure and the father being shot by a police officer. Additionally, the attempt at originality fell flat, and the cheesiness of the movie was off-putting. The revelation that the character named Lucy was actually supposed to be Lucifer, a female character, felt forced and illogical. Overall, the film was boring and lacked a coherent plot."
"What makes ""Bad Bad Bad"" such a disappointment?","Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to direct. May be she should go back to acting...on second thought she was a bad actress to. Who would put money in to producing something this bad. I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just Bad Bad Bad. The acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. The special effects, if you can call them that, where laughable. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of. We had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes. This so called movies original prints should be destroyed, all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie. Then those people should never be allowed to act, direct or film any thing but their own home movies.","""Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say.

What type of movie is this and how does it diverge from that category?,"This is listed as a documentary, it's not, it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that I suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an ""American Pie style comedy"" it's not that either.<br /><br />Basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid. Throw is a couple of dwarfs, also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls.<br /><br />Considering the 18 Rating this has very little nudity, and practically zero sex scenes, mainly I guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty.<br /><br />If you like crude Jackass behaviour without the humour, then this may be your thing, if you have any brain cells left then I would probably avoid this!","This movie is falsely labeled as a documentary and an ""American Pie"" style comedy. It fails to deliver as both. The shaky camera work and lack of humor make it a crude and unappealing film."
Did the movie live up to the expectation based on the comparison to American Pie?,"my friend bought the movie for 5 (its is not even 1 cent worth), because they wrote it was like American pie. but we would soon find out that there is a long way from American pie to that piece of crap. it is not even a comedy, its more like a really really really bad documentary. not only the story is bad, the picture and sound also sucks to. they put in some alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and drunken teens. and the result is a disaster. if you see this movie don't buy it, rather spend your money on something else, and better. if you are gonna torture yourself, then don't invite your friend/s, unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them.","The movie was a major disappointment, failing to deliver on the promise of being similar to American Pie. It lacked humor and felt more like a poorly made documentary. The storyline, visuals, and sound quality were all subpar. The inclusion of alcohol, women, dwarfs, and intoxicated teenagers resulted in a disastrous film. Watching this movie is not recommended; instead, it is suggested to spend money on something better. It is not worth subjecting yourself to this film, and it is advised not to watch it with friends unless you want to torture them."
What was the general reaction to this movie in Norway?,The fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in Norway is bizarre. This movie is just awful. This image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad. The main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck. Every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed. The fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary. And the distributors; did they even see it!? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. To label this a comedy is an insult to mankind. I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.,The fact that this movie made it all the way to the rental rack in Norway is bizarre. This movie is just awful.

Can you share your thoughts on the pacing and complexity of the plot in the movie?,"I haven't seen it in over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper.<br /><br />Yea, Lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain, a natural. I think I watched it back then most for OJ, who I had seen Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Arte Johnson.<br /><br />I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious.<br /><br />And yes, it shifted plots. In reading other posts, I remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl, but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue.<br /><br />I was going, a stamp? If it came on as a late movie, I would probably record it to check it out again, but I wouldn't be nostalgic over it. Not yet anyway.<br /><br />There are better movies from the seventies like this to check out.","The pacing of the movie was inconsistent and the plot felt disjointed with sudden shifts in focus. The introduction of the storyline involving a priceless stamp felt random and out of place, leaving me feeling disconnected and uninterested in the overall narrative. Comparing it to other movies from the same era, this one falls short in terms of engaging storytelling."
What is the overall tone of the film?,"There are laughs in this film, that is for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much about this film, is how unlikable practically all of the characters are. Other than the main two leads, everybody is a jerk. I mean, these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get. You just watch and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. Moreover, the American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure, in the end they all come together as one, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.","The film features some comedic moments, particularly due to Michael Keaton's performance. However, the characters aside from the main leads are mostly unlikable, portraying small town individuals as uncouth losers. The portrayal of American factory workers as lazy and ungrateful was off-putting, leading to a lack of enjoyment throughout the film."
What made Michael star in this movie if he's such a talented actor?,"talk about your waste of money.. im just wondering why Michael would star in such a turkey of a movie..Michael is a Great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer.. that was wonderful. as he tapes himself for his son to see it once he grows up .. Michael is such a talented actor.. so what made him do this one??? i watched it and thought it was really dumb.. i guess at one time in their career they have the crappy movies .. especially ""The Squeeze"" i didnt understand that one At all, and i feel his best performance was in ""Pacific Heights"" , his character really creeped me out.. and i really enjoyed ""Multiplicity"". .that one was so Hilarious !!! and he was just Perfect for the role of ""Batman"" .. and i kind of liked ""Night Shift"" and i love ""Johnny Dangerously"" too .. just too bad some of them end up doing lousy movies .. like this one was...","The movie was a waste of money, a turkey of a film with a dumb storyline that left viewers unimpressed. This film was a disappointment compared to Michael's past performances in movies like ""Pacific Heights,"" ""Multiplicity,"" and ""Batman."""
What are some common elements in the movie that make it an enjoyable watch for fans of 'B' movies?,"I thought I had seen this movie, twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews, and they didn't quite match up. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings. I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. Therefore I'm putting my review back: If you like the occasional 'B' movie, as I do, then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you've got a fun night of improv. Look out! Is the legend true? I think we just might find out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film? Does our blonde, manly, young hero have any chest hair? Will the exceptionally high-tech Technicolor last the entire film? You'll have to watch to find out for yourself.","The movie ""Return to Boggy Creek"" seems to cater to fans of 'B' movies with its quirky storyline about a man and three students investigating bigfoot sightings in a town. The movie offers a fun night of entertainment with possibilities for improvisation, but falls short with a not-so-stellar cast and questionable technical aspects."
What element of the movie The Booth left the reviewer feeling extremely irritated?,"My wife and I just finished watching Bûsu AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the movie. I really wish I had taken a snooze with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. He also has no redeeming qualities. I was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Asian horror cinema, but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all. If you want some good Asian cinema, check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror. Avoid The Booth like the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.","The reviewer disliked the main character's loud and grating voice, found the protagonist to lack any redeeming qualities, and expressed a wish for their early demise in the film. The reviewer also mentioned that the movie is full of scenes that make no sense and advised avoiding it, especially if one suffers from frequent migraines."
What makes this movie a letdown for many viewers?,"This film was abysmal. and not in the good way as some have claimed. First off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF is going on with this van love. The plot, basically, is: boy wants sex so buys a van (which, in fairness is quite cool). Unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get. Then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend. And he tips his van. At which point danny devito saves the day. Although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first. I gave this 2 *'s as i'm willing to assume that there's some sort of 70's Vanning subculture i'm not getting and also because there's some 70's boobage too.","The film received a dismal review with the main character being criticized for his unattractive appearance and the bizarre storyline revolving around a boy buying a van to attract girls. The plot was deemed unrealistic and lacking in depth, with the inclusion of drag racing and a rescue scene by Danny Devito being highlighted as absurd. Overall, the movie was considered disappointing and confusing by many viewers."
What makes the film Bobby's Van fall short for the audience?,"Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex. So he buys a van to aid in this quest. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills. The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time, but fell a long way short. They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add comedic value.<br /><br />I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value.","The film Bobby's Van fails to deliver on multiple fronts. The acting is subpar, the attempts at comedy fall flat, and the storyline is nothing more than a rehashed collection of clichés. The filmmakers aimed to capture the eccentricity seen in other movies of that era but missed the mark entirely. Even resorting to tired gags like a character slipping on a banana peel for laughs. It's hard to pinpoint any redeeming qualities in this film, with even the presence of a seasoned actor like DeVito contributing little to the overall viewing experience."
What is your opinion on the character development in the movie?,"This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have put it, ""more boring than church."" Maybe I don't understand it well enough, and I thought it started out pretty well, but after (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working/sleeping with her boss it just started to drag, and I struggled to keep awake. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I fail to see why others think it's so great, as I found it extremely boring. By the way, I did not watch this movie by my own free will, as I was required to see it for a Film class.","The character development in this movie felt flat and uninteresting. I struggled to connect with the characters, especially as the plot dragged on. The actions of the characters seemed disjointed and lacked depth, leaving me feeling uninvested in their journey. Overall, the lack of strong character development detracted from my enjoyment of the film."
"What is your opinion of the movie ""Robot Jox""?","R O B O T J O X.<br /><br />Burn the master.<br /><br />Grotesquely horrible.<br /><br />No ending; no closure.<br /><br />Completely and utterly the worst movie ever made.<br /><br />Replaces ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" as the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />I hate this utterly unacted, unedited, unscripted, undirected, unproduced mess of a thing called ""Robot Jox"" - and I just found out - THEY MADE A SECOND ONE!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their movies. This mess of a thing makes those movies only bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing. This is the only movie for which I have ever said this - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW!!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.","The reviewer strongly dislikes the movie ""Robot Jox"", calling it the worst movie ever made with no ending, closure, and terrible acting, directing, editing. They even believe it's worse than ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"". The reviewer emphatically suggests that the movie should be removed from Netflix."
Do you think the concept of robots fighting each other is interesting in the movie?,"What an awful movie! The Idea of robots fighting each other is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, real human action laughable, acting non-existent and special effects (on which, this type of movie must depend) are archaic. I thought it must have been made around '80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990. That's 5 years after Aliens! OK, lots of people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think 'what's the point?'. it looks totally unbelievable. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re-written story because I still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other.",
Were the special effects up to par in this movie?,"There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. The base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash. However, that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie. Had he waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)","The special effects in this movie were really disappointing. It was clear that a lack of budget affected the overall quality of the visual effects, making some scenes difficult to watch and not captivating at all. The filmmakers seemed to have ambitious goals with the effects but unfortunately, they fell short, leaving a lot to be desired in terms of visual appeal."
Did this movie live up to its expectations in terms of acting and set design?,"I actually paid to see this movie in the theater.<br /><br />It would get a 1-rating, but the fight scenes between the robots are okay, and there's a surprise.<br /><br />I realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. I don't have a problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons. But, one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap. I mean, couldn't they even make it ""look"" good?<br /><br />The other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor, but at the time, I was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being.<br /><br />Thankfully, the experience was over in only 85 minutes.","The movie disappoints with its cheap and cheesy set design, as well as poor acting performances. The only saving grace are the somewhat decent robot fight scenes and a small surprise element."
"What kind of atmosphere does ""Robot Jox"" create for the audience?","Think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as ""Power Rangers"" and you have this film from 1990, ""Robot Jox"". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it isn't all bad to watch. There are as I recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. So it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.","""Robot Jox"" offers a dark and less colorful take on the concept of giant robot battles reminiscent of kid shows like ""Power Rangers"". The film features two epic robot fights and a plot twist involving a traitor, but ultimately lacks a lasting impact. Despite the fun factor of watching giant robots in action, the overall film may not be compelling enough to warrant repeated viewings."
What elements of the film failed to captivate the reviewer?,"Sadly I don't remember the book anymore, but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality. It does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. However there's hope ... I've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. So in conclusion I must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.","The film represents a typical German production of low quality, with characters that are overly simplified and exaggerated, lacking nuances in their performances. Even well-known actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren't couldn't save this poor spectacle."
What changes in the characters and storyline did the reviewer dislike in this movie adaptation?,"This movie is an abomination, and its making should have been considered a capital crime.<br /><br />One of the great mysteries of film-making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It is a tale of a really gripping mystery, nice old-fashioned romance, and dry English humor. Why did the makers have to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman to an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of Gordon's struggle to save the accused, etc., etc.? These producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person's product.","The reviewer was highly critical of the changes made in the characters and storyline of the movie adaptation, expressing strong disapproval of the deviation from the original plot and character portrayals."
"What did you find disappointing about ""The Waltzers"" aka ""Going Places""?","I loved Dewaere in Series Noir. His talent is trivialized in ""The Waltzers"" aka ""Going Places"". Okay, it's a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways; many folks find such behavior amusing. This was a boring, pointless exercise designed to shock. I find the smirk on Blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoying. Series Noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior. From the first moment when we see Patric Dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero we'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours. When we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy Depardieu in ""Going Places"" we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul-draining. I have trouble eking even a ""3"" for this annoying distraction.","The reviewer found ""The Waltzers"" aka ""Going Places"" to be a boring and pointless exercise designed to shock, with annoying characters and soul-draining content."
What aspects of the film did you find enjoyable or entertaining?,"When I first saw this film, I thought it should have come from the children's section - It's very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely lacks the ""romantic chemistry"" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the sole exception. This film appears a bit forced, the directing lacks substance, and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful, it didn't put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like I said..it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflicting film, but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie.","The film is very fun, at times humorous, and has a good story, but lacks romantic chemistry between the actors. Walter Matthau's performance as Albert Einstein stands out, but the directing feels forced, lacking substance. The music is also notably terrible and mood-dampening. Overall, it can be entertaining if not taken seriously, almost fitting to be in the children's section."
Can you talk about the chemistry between the main characters in the movie?,"Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****","The chemistry between the main characters in the movie feels forced and lacks genuine depth. Tim Robbins' performance as a garage mechanic who falls in love with Meg Ryan's character is forgettable, as he fails to bring any intensity or impact to the role. The romantic comedy with the gimmick of Albert Einstein's niece being involved feels contrived and fails to engage the audience. Walter Matthau's portrayal of Einstein comes across as cartoonish and does not add any value to the film. Overall, the movie comes off as sugary, predictable, and lacking in both wit and substance."
What are some reasons why this film fell flat for the critics?,"Director Fred Schepisi(Roxanne) directs this well intentioned, but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein(Matthau) trying to hook his scientific niece(Ryan) up with ordinary guy Tim Robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's. To get Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film. Its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie. I would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan.","The film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue, despite the efforts of the talented cast. The concept is cute, but it ultimately fails to deliver a memorable viewing experience."
What shortcomings are highlighted in the DVD release of the movie?,"About time they released this movie on DVD. I know some say WB rush the release of this movie because of The Dreamgirls movie. But, how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you catalog since 1976.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 DD sound. come on WB, you can do much better then this. The audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help.<br /><br />Seem WB didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales. They could have kept the CD which by the way dose not have all the songs the original CD has. <br /><br />Would I recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it is a classic film. But WB need to go add some more special feature. Take notes from other group movies, The Five Heatbeats, or The Temptation were you may view just the performance, and the sound on both are much, much, much better than this DVD.","The DVD release of this movie lacks special features, 5.1 surround sound, and has poor audio and picture quality. The absence of attention to detail and limited content compared to the original CD versions is disappointing, suggesting a rushed and neglectful approach by WB."
What setting does the film supposedly take place in and what comparison is made to describe it?,"Having the In-Laws over for the weekend? Then this is the film to hasten their departure, failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging.<br /><br />The film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship, which is more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity D list. An interesting piece of added amusement is playing ""Spot the Villain"" as passengers join the ship. You won't be wrong!!!! With a script that sinks faster than a brick, clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller, action movie and gore-fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them.<br /><br />A must watch film, if only to laugh at how bad it is.","The film fails to impress with a plot full of holes, a cast from the celebrity D list, and a script that is laughably bad. The attempt to encompass multiple genres like thriller, action, and gore-fest falls flat, making it a must-watch only for its sheer badness."
Can you describe the plot of the movie without using complex words or sentences?,"Van Dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film, as indeed must every single individual involved. To be honest I am rather embarrassed to admit I watched it from start to finish. Production values are somewhere between the original series of 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'. Most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. As for the acting performances, if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable 'story' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in 'Maiden Voyage'. Worse still, you can't even fast forward to the sex scenes, because there aren't any. An appallingly dreadful film.",
Would you recommend this film to someone who enjoys quality acting and production?,"The cast of this film contain some of New Zealander's better actors, many of who I have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. Imagine ""Under Siege"" meets ""The Love Boat"", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.<br /><br />If you are an actor, I recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer.","The film's use of fake American accents and subpar production values, with a set resembling an old car ferry and actors primarily from a New Zealand soap opera, make it a cringe-worthy viewing experience. It seems more like a drunken idea from a party than a professionally made movie."
Can you tell us about your experience watching the movie?,"What a joke. I am watching it on Channel 1 and I think watching paint dry is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that got him roped into this nightmare. Terrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. It so terrible, it's funny. It's suppose to be full of suspense, but it more a comedy. If you want to see terrible acting, ridiculous script writing and sub-par plot, check this movie out. If I was Van Dien, I would not only ask for my 10% from my agent, but fire the bastard in the process. What a turkey. It's not even fit to be on MST 3K!! It would be a good movie to cure you insomnia. I especially love the part where Van Dien is throw overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes! I can only image that this was written by non-union writers taking advantage of the writer's strike. What a horrible movie!!!","I recently wasted two hours of my life watching this absolute disaster of a film. The plot was beyond ridiculous, the acting was laughably bad, and the overall direction of the movie was severely lacking. It failed to deliver on any level and instead left me questioning why I even bothered watching it. Save yourself the agony and skip this one at all costs."
What were the main issues with the film according to the reviewer?,"A truly dreadful film. I did not know initially that this was a Kiwi effort - but very soon I started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake American ones. Why did it need to be set n America anyway? - it could have been set in NZ and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with American accents? A bad bad film. I am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at a Segal/Willis type action man flick.A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! If there was any TAXPAYER money in this piece of trash, I would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the Treasury. I am still reeling (get it? pun, reeling!) at the absolute garbage I have just seen. Why did I continue to watch? Well, I am a movie fanatic and cant help ,myself!","The reviewer found the attempts at American accents by the characters to be dreadful and felt setting the film in America unnecessary. They also criticized the film for being a poor imitation of action films starring actors like Steven Segal or Bruce Willis. Overall, the reviewer labeled the movie as a total waste of money and expressed surprise that it even made it to the screen."
Can you describe some of the major flaws or disappointments in the movie?,"I think I've seen worse films, so I'm giving this a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been!! Possibly Xtro (nasty & dull) or possibly Creep (just plain dull), but it is a struggle to think of something worse. It's difficult to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor man's Under Siege, starring an even poorer man's Jean Claude Van Damme. The only redeeming feature was seeing Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know.<br /><br />Judging from this site, he's been stuck in TV movie hell.... Casper, be more selective.... please!!!!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I've just turned over and there's a half decent film on called Criminal Law...... now I'm beginning to get really resentful about the last 1.5hrs!!!","The movie was a struggle to watch and easily forgettable. It felt like a poor imitation of better action movies like Under Siege, with a less impressive lead actor. Casper Van Dien's appearance was the only slightly interesting aspect. The viewer may be left feeling frustrated and longing for a better movie experience."
What are some of the major shortcomings of the film Maiden Voyage as highlighted in a review?,"Maiden Voyage is just that. I'd like to say straight away that I watched 5mins of this before I just couldn't stand it anymore. As already stated in another comment, this film doesn't fall into the whole ""so bad it's good"" thing, it's just bad. The acting is awful, the sfx are poor, and the story is bland and stupid. Even the extras suck, the ""bag guy guards"" and such appear to hold their weapons like water pistols.<br /><br />Don't even bother watching this film, the only thing special about it is that, no matter how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.","The review criticizes the film for its poor acting, low-quality special effects, and a dull and nonsensical story. The reviewer also points out the inadequacy of the extras, commenting on their unconvincing portrayal as ""bad guy guards."" Ultimately, the reviewer suggests that watching this film is a waste of time and that viewers are bound to be disappointed regardless of their expectations."
"What makes ""Wendigo"" fall short for many viewers?","I first learned of the Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's ""Scary Stories"" books: according to that story, the Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you along, and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you. While it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion, Schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea.<br /><br />The movie ""Wendigo"" doesn't. It basically consists of every horror flick cliché: family moves to new house and strange things start happening, anyone who harms them is asking for it, and everyone had better listen to the old Indian guy. I've seen this stuff so many times that I no longer bother to count.<br /><br />Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on ""Malcolm in the Middle"") have done far better than this.","The movie ""Wendigo"" fails to deliver a fresh and engaging storyline, instead relying on tired horror movie clichés that make it predictable and unoriginal. The performances by Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan are not enough to redeem the film from its lackluster plot."
What was disappointing about the movie adaptation of the Wendigo story?,"If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo, I suggest you pick up a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book.<br /><br />I loved the book when I read it as a kid (In ""Campfire Chillers"" by E.M. Freeman)and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (Politically Correct) undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film. When the book was written PC didn't even exist.<br /><br />My suggestion is don't waste your time or money!! If you see it on the video store shelf LEAVE IT THERE.","The movie had nothing to do with the original book and featured unnecessary politically correct undertones, making it a waste of time and money."
Were you bored waiting for the character WENDINGO to appear in the movie?,"for all the subtle charms this student film may contain, was anyone else bored to death waiting WENDINGO to show his paper macho face??<br /><br />the anti-climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i'm all into exploring America's dark underbelly, but this is a turd-a-flambé that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p.clarkson looks hot taking it.<br /><br />sadly, from a guy from wings.<br /><br />the best 2 minutes the film has to offer.<br /><br />if you felt like ripping off DELIVERANCE, you could do better.","The film's anti-climax ruined any momentum it had, making it a disappointing experience. Despite potential in exploring America's dark side, the movie falls flat and is only watchable for a brief scene featuring P. Clarkson. Overall, a lackluster film that failed to deliver on its promises."
What were some of the elements of the film that fell short for you?,"i was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box. Having said that, the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me. I kept waiting for that big AHHHHH or BOO! But it never came.<br /><br />Furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects. Thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if your looking for a low-budget but well conceived horror movie.","The film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype. Additionally, the poor filming and special effects took away from the overall experience, relying too heavily on showing everything rather than creating suspense through atmosphere and viewer imagination."
What were some disappointing aspects of the movie?,"As I was watching this movie I was thinking,OK it'll get good any moment...I was wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it was over. A complete waste of 92 minutes. All seriousness aside the best part was when the Wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn't really even see him that good. And the tail end was really kind of dumb as well. There was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down. The worse part is there was more talk of the Wendigo then there was Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad,you definitely couldn't tell it by this movie.","The movie was a complete let down, with too many moments that built up anticipation only to end in disappointment. The highlight of the film seemed to be when the Wendigo finally appeared, which was hard to even make out clearly. Despite all the talk surrounding the creature, it was poorly executed in the movie, leaving much to be desired."
"Could you enjoy a movie where the main characters are decent but the plot lacks suspense and the overall quality is reminiscent of older, low-budget films?","if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one... incredible bad... the main characters (the mom, the dad and son) are OK. Specially the mother she's a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary. But does the the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. the script hasn't any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing. If you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep. oh... actually there was something funny: the movie's from 2001 but we couldn't realize it since the image is so bad (like on mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80's).","The movie barely scratches the surface of what a thriller should be, with a weak script and antiquated visuals overshadowing the decent performances by the main characters. It's better to skip this one and opt for a more engaging and up-to-date movie choice."
Do you think this movie was successful in delivering a truly scary and original storyline?,"I've seen many horror shows over the years, like Nightstalker, that dealt with the Wendigo legend, so I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the Halloween season. Man was I mistaken. The whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy, but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property. Ve-ery scary - not! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser.<br /><br />It's getting harder and harder to believe anything Hollywood puts forward about scary movies, since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore. What idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made? Go back to the drawing board fellas, and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around.","The movie builds up expectations for a terrifying horror experience, only to disappoint with a simplistic and unoriginal plot focusing on revenge over a property dispute. It fails to deliver genuine scares and ends up feeling like a waste of time. The lack of creativity in Hollywood's scary movie offerings is becoming increasingly frustrating for audiences seeking something fresh and chilling."
"What are some of the criticisms of the movie ""Angel""?","I suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll enjoy the film. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it wasn't there. The pacing was practically backward, plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of dread, or tension, or ANYTHING.<br /><br />Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman on speed. That's not scary. It doesn't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by MTV. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience.<br /><br />Terrible film.","The movie ""Angel"" falls short in delivering a tight story due to its excessive dialogue that does not drive the plot forward. The pacing is perceived as backwards, with key plot points getting lost among unnecessary conversation. The film lacks a sense of dread or tension, with flashy camera effects serving as distractions rather than enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Ultimately, the movie fails to evoke fear, leading to audience members feeling more likely to laugh derisively by the end."
What could have made the movie more enjoyable for the audience?,"This would be a watchable Hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing. It relies on the typical American thriller plot - ""who is going to outsmart everyone"". Acting is below average, but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises. Film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material. All in all, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a film to watch. I guess that would be enough to say on this film, everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough.","The movie seems to lack proper editing which makes it difficult to engage with. The plot is quite predictable, and the acting overall is not very impressive, except for the detective's performance. The cinematography and sound quality are subpar, giving the film a raw and unfinished feel. Overall, the movie comes across as mediocre and looks more like a student film project."
"What were some disappointments in Part Two of the movie ""The Impossible Planet""?","Loved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a disappointment part two 'The Satan Pit' is. The cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was - nothing coming out of the pit. Then ages spent crawling round air vents to pad out the story, the Beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence, so no Doctor/villain confrontation I'd been anticipating. The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the TARDIS fell through the planet crust. And finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason - I mean, why not plunge the Beast into the Hole as soon as the pit opened? Why not plunge him in all those years ago instead of imprisoning him anyway. Why not - I could go on but I've lost interest...","The second part of ""The Impossible Planet"" called ""The Satan Pit"" was a letdown for me. The build-up to something coming out of the pit amounted to nothing, with a lackluster villain in the Beast and no satisfying Doctor/villain confrontation. The inclusion of the TARDIS inside the pit was questionable, and the solution to the problem felt forced and illogical. The excessive time spent crawling through air vents made the storyline feel drawn out and uninteresting."
Would you recommend this movie to someone who enjoys bizarre and unsettling films involving dental torture scenes?,"I don't know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the weirdest movies I've seen in a long time. It is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who's into gore & splatter. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes. The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite unsettling.<br /><br />The humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for.<br /><br />If you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment, give it a try!<br /><br />My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)","The film may be captivating for those interested in gore and splatter, as it includes elaborate scenes of dental torture that play on viewers' fears. However, the movie may come across as weird and disjointed, with moments that are both unsettling and dull. The hidden humor may not resonate with everyone, making it a niche choice for those who appreciate this peculiar form of entertainment. Overall, the movie might be too bizarre for those with a more mainstream taste in films."
What are some elements that stood out in the movie review you received?,"Well, I do like the gore in this movie - it is genuingly unsetteling. Anyone that's been to the dentist will know why. The story really isn't that bad, Corbin Bersen's character's motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies.<br /><br />I've seen worse acting, directing, script, etc. but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie. So it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly, exactly the same thing as this movie. Just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist, then this is the movie for you!","The reviewer mentioned that the gore in the movie is genuinely unsettling and that the story isn't that bad. They appreciated Corbin Bersen's character's motivations, stating they make more sense than in most horror movies. However, overall, the reviewer classified the film as a bad horror movie with mediocre acting, directing, and script. The sequel is also criticized for being a repetition of the same storyline. The reviewer suggested that the film might only appeal to those who enjoy seeing people tortured at the dentist."
What makes the concept of a mad dentist a perfect subject for a horror movie?,"There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of, let's say, little monsters or scary looking dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really.<br /><br />Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps, and he brings his anger and frustration to his work. Well, give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what happens next...<br /><br />As I said, brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should. In particular the ending is a huge let down. Last note: watch for Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count On Me, Eternal Sunshine...) in this one.<br /><br />5/10.","The movie had a brilliant idea but was not delivered as well as it should have been. The ending was a huge let down, and while the concept was intriguing, the execution fell short. The movie only received a 5/10 rating."
What sets this movie apart from other mockumentaries?,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project, and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. There is no subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. And while the lines aren't funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to people who like ""comedies"" in the vein of ""Big Momma's House"" or ""Norbit""; people who think that words like ""butt"" are inherently hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.","Despite trying to mimic the success of Spinal Tap with a hip hop twist, this movie falls short in every aspect. The acting and writing feel amateurish, with humor that only appeals to those who enjoy low-brow comedies like ""Big Momma's House"" or ""Norbit"". There's a lack of subtlety, failed attempts at dead-pan delivery, and an overall absence of any semblance of a documentary feel. Ultimately, it misses the mark for anyone looking for intelligent humor or a well-executed mockumentary."
Was the animation quality of the movie well-received by viewers?,"I cant describe how terrible this movie is. Am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting? The Men of Rohan look 100% fake with their poorly colored hair, that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like. The orcs looked terrible. Why does gandalf walk with a bad limp? Why cant they pronounce things correctly? Saruman isnt Aruman. There were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation*sp* of Tolkiens characters. All and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal, it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion. Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkiens work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better then this dribble. 2/10","Oh man, this movie was a disaster in terms of animation. The characters looked fake, especially the Men of Rohan with their poorly colored hair. The orcs were a mess too. And don't get me started on Gandalf's awkward limp. The mispronunciations of Tolkien's characters were cringe-worthy. Overall, a terrible adaptation that even led to the studio cancelling the sequel. Just watch the old Hobbit cartoon instead."
What are some criticisms of the movie besides the animation?,"Some people don't like the animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done. There are lots of older cartoons that I just love. My problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was constructed. The characters are all just... well, goofy. And for this movie, they shouldn't be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a limping problem (for starters.) Just the way they acted in general annoyed me. My two sisters and I were laughing through most of this movie. I think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones, they wouldn't have gone. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy it. There are few movies that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, although it ranks up there. Or down there, depending on your view.",Some people found the characters to be goofy and their behavior annoying. The movie was described as giving the viewer a headache and was considered to be one of the worst movies seen by some.
"Which fantasy movie has a rushed pace, lacks character development, features a mix of traditional cartoons and live-action scenes, and leaves out important scenes from the book?","I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson's trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is rushed, many important scenes from the book are left out, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over, which I found distracting. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished. There are some good points- the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter. Watch this one if you're in a hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you haven't read the book you'll probably be confused, because there is a lot missing from this version. 4 out of 10.","The movie being discussed disappointed viewers as it failed to live up to the expectations set by the later trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The rushed pace, lack of character development, odd animation style, and incomplete storyline left many feeling unsatisfied. While there were some redeeming qualities like exciting battle scenes and faithful book dialogue, overall, the movie fell short with a rating of 4 out of 10."
What were some of the major issues criticized in the movie adaptation by Bashki?,"Bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then slapped silly for this attempt. The animation was poor, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly blaring, and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when I first saw it. Now I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is just plain pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.","The animation in the movie was subpar, the characters looked absurd, the music was overwhelmingly loud, and the film rushed through the storyline, doing a disservice to Tolkien's masterpiece. The attempt to adapt the book into a movie was met with sheer disappointment and dislike from viewers."
What makes this horror movie unique and entertaining for a bad movie night?,"Two houses, one street, one phone booth, one car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie. All you need is some blue light, ambient music and...done. Not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy though! <br /><br />I like to organize ""bad movie evenings"" from time to time. The concept is really simple: get some booze, get some film-loving friends, and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer. For such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best. Laughs guaranteed!<br /><br />The bizarre thing is, van Rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement. To be a witness to this you'll have to listen to the DVD's commentary track. Again: disbelieve and laughs guaranteed!","The movie is described as a hilarious and entertaining choice for a bad movie night, with elements like a phone booth, a car, a girl next door, a boy next door, and a zombie creating a fun and bizarre atmosphere. The film's director is even said to defend the movie as a great achievement, adding to the humor when watching it with friends and some booze. Laugh-riot guaranteed!"
What makes this movie stand out despite being considered one of the worst films ever made?,"this is not just a bad film, it's one of the worst films ever. it's so bad that i found it to be quite enjoyable. the acting, oh my god, the script, you gotta be kiddin'. how can you imagine the writer coming up with things like: - a kid who makes fireworks in school, fireworks SO powerfull, that when someone gets hit by it, they fly a hundred yards backwards and explode. -a girl is trapped in the celler, the killer is trying to break open the door. she gets a drill, but the wire isn't long enough. she first makes an extension cord, oh the horror, and then, when she's done, she drills through the door and drills through the head of the killer. WOW - and there are plenty more examples like that. oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he used to be great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot/Cool hand Luke)","This movie is a disaster in terms of acting and script, filled with absurd and unrealistic scenes that make you question the sanity of the writer. The inclusion of over-the-top elements, like a kid making fireworks powerful enough to send people flying backwards, or a girl crafting a makeshift extension cord to kill the killer with a drill, only add to the ridiculousness of this film. The absence of any semblance of logic or coherent storytelling makes you wonder what happened to the once-great George Kennedy."
"What are some unintentionally funny moments in ""Intensive Care""?","I thought ""Intensive Care"" was quite bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's somewhat suspenseful, but never a good shocker.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD<br /><br />The fun lies in ridiculous moments. But the all-time classic moment is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He lies moaning in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels beside him and asks ""Poor Peter, shall I get you a band-aid?"".<br /><br />This movie was shot in Dutch and English. To spare costs, all license plates are USA, and the background in the news studio is a skyline of Manhattan. Very funny if you're Dutch and watching the original version in Dutch.","Overall, ""Intensive Care"" was considered quite bad and failed to deliver a good shock factor. One memorable scene includes a character being stabbed and beaten, only to have another character ask if they need a band-aid, resulting in unintentional humor. Additionally, inconsistencies like using USA license plates in a Dutch and English film added to the hilarity for those watching the original Dutch version."
What movie ended the acting careers of Koen Wouters and Nada van Nie?,"Koen Wouters is a flemish singer and presenter. In the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well. But this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. It also ended the acting career of dutch actress Nada van Nie who went on being a football-wife a TV presenter and program-maker. I actually did see this in an ( almost empty) theatre because I used to be a fan of the band of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I so regret spending money on it. It looks cheap, it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad it's funny. I am not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money.","The movie looks cheap, has a terrible story, and is executed badly in every possible way. It ended the acting careers of Koen Wouters and Nada van Nie, leaving audiences feeling it was an incredible waste of time and money."
"What are some elements of the movie ""Intensive Care"" that make it stand out as a horror film?","""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made.This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner.The acting is abysmal,the action is slow and the climax is laughable.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.The killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.You'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me!","""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made. The film offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations, with abysmal acting, slow action, and a laughable climax. The veteran actor, George Kennedy, is wasted in his role, and the movie's attempt to mimic American slasher films like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" falls flat. The killings are more hilarious than scary, and the dialogue is painfully stupid. Overall, ""Intensive Care"" is a piece of trash that might provide some entertainment if you're in the mood to laugh at its shortcomings."
"What are some drawbacks of the movie ""Sniper""?","Not much to say on this one. A plot you can pretty much peg, in the first 10 minutes. Nothing overly wrong with this film, very little action for an action film. There was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally. Whether an action film is the right genre to do that with, I'm still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to, as it had little twists and a straightforward plot. I was probably guilty of that, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better.<br /><br />4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10's)","The plot was predictable from the beginning, lacked sufficient action for an action film, and had minimal depth in character development. The genre may not have been the best fit for exploring intricate emotions. Overall, the film was easy to watch without full attention, with little surprises and a straightforward storyline."
What is the overall tone of the movie as depicted in the positive review?,"Eleven ""great"" filmmakers, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes each of sheer tedium, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a ""hip hip hooray!"" for terorism in his amateurish segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole thing. Claude Lelouch focussing on a trivial and cliched love affair. Ken Loach of the UK focussing on Chile. Etc. etc.","The movie is described as a collection of ""garbage,"" characterized by tedium, sophistry, condescension, and self-indulgence. The segments are criticized for being amateurish, focusing on terrorism, and lacking substance or relevance. The filmmakers are accused of either ignoring significant events or trivializing them, leading to a negative and dismissive portrayal of the film."
Can you explain more about why the movie disappointed you so much?,"I have never panned a film on-line, but I felt moved to do so, after seeing this one. One doesn't show up at someone's funeral and say to the bereaved, ""My relatives died, so why should I care about yours?""<br /><br />Minus the propaganda, there was little, if anything, that could be called ""art."" As the daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick. Any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated, not ignored it.<br /><br />The word ""chutzpah"" comes to mind. As a writer, there are few subjects I would stay away from: the Holocaust is one; this is another. I wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant (and inept).","The movie was described as lacking substance, utilizing deafness in a misleading way that felt disrespectful. The reviewer critiqued the film for being more focused on propaganda than on genuine artistry. The use of certain elements came across as gimmicky rather than thoughtfully incorporated into the story. The overall tone of the review suggests a deep disappointment and a feeling of disrespect towards the film."
What is the general tone of the movie?,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail?If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Contrived plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out. (This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint). Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, Ive been there- and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison. C'mon. Rent Another Day in Paradise instead.","The movie 'Midnight Express for the MTV crowd' tries to combine the glitz of Beverly Hills 90210 with the grit of a Thai jail, but falls short with a poorly executed plot filled with contrived twists, lackluster dialogue, and unresolved issues. The movie tries to create tension in unrealistic scenarios, making certain moments feel out of place and preposterous. Consider watching a different film like Another Day in Paradise instead."
Can you tell me about a movie you recently watched?,"I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, after seeing ""Return to Paradise,"" which I found to be gritty. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which I think was partly stolen from ""Return to Paradise."" <br /><br />Maybe I was expecting too much. <br /><br />On the positive side Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I didnt like Danes's character and first and found her very annoying. <br /><br />I couldnt see anything realistic about the film. It could of been done so much better, for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror. It was too cheery a movie to be realistic. There could also of been more action and tension<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the ""tragic"" ending. I couldnt of predicted that. But by that time I really didnt care what happened to them.<br /><br />3/10","I was so disappointed with this film. I had high hopes for it but I found it to be unrealistic and lacking in depth. The plot seemed borrowed from another movie and the characters, although well-acted, were unlikable. I wish the film had focused more on the prison conditions and built up the tension. The only redeeming quality was the unexpected ending, but by then, I had lost interest in the characters. Overall, I would give it a 3 out of 10."
What is the point of the film?,"A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the ending to this film?<br /><br />In fact, what is the point of it?<br /><br />The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline.<br /><br />The performances of the cast are questionable, if not believable.<br /><br />Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film? I guess we have to wait for the sequel.<br /><br />","While the story had potential, the lack of a proper ending left viewers confused and detached emotionally. The quick-paced scenes and questionable performances made it hard to understand the storyline. It feels like the film is missing a conclusion, leaving viewers wondering if they need to wait for a sequel."
What did you not like about the movie 'Brokedown Palace'?,"Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would ever like to see. I also did not like the movie when some Aussie man smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I would not go to that country no matter what after I saw this movie. In fact this movie stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I also would rather stick to the United States instead. After I saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theatre and had my money refunded because I cannot tolerate this movie. If you are going to to Thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler, forget this!","The movie 'Brokedown Palace' was a complete disappointment. The storyline revolving around drug smuggling in Thailand was unappealing, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I found the accusation made against the main characters to be absurd and not something I could enjoy watching. The movie ultimately led me to have negative perceptions about Thailand and the idea of traveling there. The overall experience of watching this film was so unpleasant that I demanded a refund in the middle of the movie and decided to leave the theatre. If you are looking for a movie to avoid, 'Brokedown Palace' would be a perfect choice."
Did the movie deliver on its promise of providing engaging soft core scenes?,"It's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, the humor's cheesy, and so is the acting. But after all it is a soft core movie, which is expected and doesn't matter because what you really want is the sex. Which gets me to the biggest problem of all, there barely is any of it. Which makes you feel like you're watching TV at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and the one that is on was made by some college kid that's going nowhere in that industry. You're left a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene, a lot of times you are thinking something is going to happen, then just left hanging. The one(maybe two, or one with two parts)that actually goes somewhere is very pleasing though. I personally can't recommend this unless you found it in a clear out bin for a dollar or two. If you lucking for a good movie with a plot and good acting, you don't want this. If you looking for a good soft core lesbian film, you don't want this either.","The movie falls short in delivering on its promise of engaging soft core scenes, leaving viewers feeling disappointed and bored. The lack of substantial adult content makes it feel like a low-budget production that fails to live up to expectations. If you're seeking a movie with a captivating plot and quality acting, this film is not the one to watch. Similarly, if you're specifically looking for a well-executed soft core lesbian film, this movie also misses the mark."
What elements make this movie disappointing and lackluster?,"**Possible Spoilers**<br /><br />This straight-to-video mess combines a gun-toting heroine, grade-Z effects, nazis, a mummy and endless lesbian footage and it's still boring; the video's 45 minute running time only SEEMS like Eternity.The only good part is one of the blooper outtakes, wherein the bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptologist into a chair--and one villain's foot almost gets crushed under a chair leg. Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch televised golf, bowling or tennis instead.",
"What are some of the drawbacks of the film ""Mummy Raider""?","Someone had a great idea: let's have Misty Mundae do her own, R-rated version of Lara Croft - firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits, but topless as well. It WAS indeed a great idea. The problem is that the people who had it couldn't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a ""film"" that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts (often in slow-motion), and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage. The appeal of Misty Mundae is still evident: she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl-next-door beauty. However her two female co-stars here, with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene, are nowhere near her league. If ""Mummy Raider"" was presented as a Youtube video, I'd rate it higher, but as a ""film"" destined for DVD consumption it cannot get more than 1/2 a * out of 4.","The film ""Mummy Raider"" lacks a strong script and adequate budget, leading to a low-quality production that seems to have been mostly shot inside a garage. Despite featuring Misty Mundae in a role inspired by Lara Croft, the film falls short in terms of length and relies too much on replaying scenes in slow-motion. Additionally, the supporting cast fails to match Mundae's appeal, especially during a lengthy lesbian scene. Overall, the film struggles to be more than a below-average production, receiving only 1/2 a star out of 4."
What is the main reason for the existence of this movie?,"Not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short, this thing exists for one reason, to have a lesbian three-way. There are worse reasons to exist. One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie. Misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character, like Lara Croft, that they make nude calenders of her, you know that a soft-core flick is set to explode. Unfortunately, this is pretty pathetic. Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand is fingering air. Watch this if you just can't get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever.","The main reason this movie exists is for a lesbian three-way scene. Despite having the potential to be a decent feature length film, it falls short due to a fake and awkwardly executed sex scene and lacks substance beyond the sexual content. The characters Misty and Ruby are underdeveloped, and the overall quality of the film is pretty pathetic."
What makes the characters in the movie lack depth and fail to resonate with the audience?,"There is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters. A bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue. I've just seen this on TV and I didn't think it was a 'film' as such, more a post-'This Life' indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it. Stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately, irrelevant middle class ""lifestyle"" crap that takes itself far too seriously. It's got David Baddiel in it and that bird out of ""Cold Feet"", you know what to expect. There was a lot of this stuff about in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise...""they're educated and doing drugs? friends, but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships? sounds great!"". This kind of nonsense, and post-Guy Ritchie comedy- gangster stuff...dark days. If you have taste, this will annoy you to the point of violence.","The characters in the film are described as spoiled middle-class individuals engaging in drug use, shallow relationships, and inconsequential arguments. The movie lacks proper drama and fails to provoke any emotional connection with the audience. It is criticized for taking itself too seriously and presenting irrelevant middle-class ""lifestyle"" content that offers no real substance. The presence of well-known actors like David Baddiel and actors from ""Cold Feet"" does not redeem the lackluster storyline or character development, leading to an overall sense of annoyance and disappointment for viewers with discerning taste."
What made you feel so negatively about this movie?,"I'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a film. But I can't understand how this one got made. Who made it? How could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film? Did they do a weekend course at some film school, get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to be in it? Or was he by any chance a longtime family friend/distant relation doing this out of sheer, misplaced kindness? I don't care, don't want to know. Even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it, mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera. Meanwhile the DOP must have been the gaffer from Neighbours, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the script, the direction and editing were all abysmal, and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that I can't be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film.","The movie has been described as a complete disaster by many viewers. The poor quality of the script, direction, editing, and sound design have left audiences feeling apathetic and frustrated. The lead actor's lackluster performance and apparent embarrassment to be associated with the film have only added to the overall disappointment."
What could make someone want to avoid watching this movie?,"honestly, if anyone has a brain, there's not 1 positive thing<br /><br />to say about this movie what so ever. <br /><br />I lost my $1 renting this. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith saying ""If you got a dream, you got to protect it"". <br /><br />all the actors must've been bored or had no fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay *however you spell it* was better then all the actors in this movie, when he played a psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie, and have anything good to say, you IQ, must be extremely low, with such bad taste in movies, it hurts. Thank YOU...and the TRUTH, has been spoken!<br /><br />Save yourself from the misery. <br /><br />Get Devil's Rejects, now that's a classic.","The movie received a scathing review with the critic expressing regret over spending money to rent it, and even preferring to watch a different movie starring Will Smith. The actors were criticized for appearing bored or lacking fame, with a comparison made to Matthew McConaughey's performance in a different film that was deemed superior. The critic sternly advised against watching the movie and recommended opting for a different, classic film instead."
Did you find the characters' decisions and the pacing of the movie to be confusing or frustrating?,"I was expecting to love this movie--film noir, serial killer, dark irony. I was baffled by many choices the characters made (""Hey, I know they're creepy looking, but let's hook up for a cross-country road trip anyway!""), found the pacing to be glacial, and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer.<br /><br />Thinking about it now, this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense-o-meter (1992 model) before starting to film...",
Can you elaborate on why the film is being described as amateur and lacking substance?,"The subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, exhibitionist movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death ""poetry"". To be sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), but with no development leading up to or away from it. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie.","The film is criticized for lacking depth and substance, being compared to the work of an amateur or moody high school student. The reviewer points out that while it may disturb some viewers, it lacks the sensibility, technique, and talent required to truly make an impact. The film is described as containing one evocative image but failing to develop it into something meaningful, suggesting a lack of vision and direction from the director."
What are some major flaws in the film that hinder its quality?,"I'm sorry but this is just awful. I have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern day Japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of Busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say ""Hey my watch has stopped""? Imagine lines like that being repeated 15+ times before they say anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell.","The acting in this movie is simply dreadful. The repetitive and uninspired lines delivered by the characters really take away from the overall viewing experience. The plot of modern Japanese soldiers being transported back in time could have been interesting, but it falls flat due to the poor execution of dialogue and performances."
What was the main issue with the characters in the movie that led to the viewer disconnecting from the story?,"(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /><br />Normally a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch this tonight. I had to switch it off before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding in rude, disrespectful and reckless to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, ""At least we won't have to watch her anymore."" Keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving, but it was too far gone for me by then. I simply wasn't enjoying it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to care for the protagonist, you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner--if it's nearly an hour in and I don't care, it's too late.<br /><br />The supporting cast was sincere and well played--I felt for *them!*--and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, that wasn't enough to carry the film for me.","The characters, particularly the daughter and mother, came across as self-absorbed, rude, and disrespectful, leading to a lack of sympathy from the audience. Despite a strong performance by Diane Keaton, the inability to connect with the characters early on made it hard to stay engaged, ultimately leading the viewer to stop watching before the second hour."
What are some common elements that contributed to the negative reviews of the film?,"I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but thought ""Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching"". I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so inept, clichéd and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering ""What were they thinking?"". Very, very sad that it has come to this. Don't waste your time.","The film was described as awful, with a poorly written and clichéd script. The characters lacked believability and were incredibly unlikeable. The acting was criticized as looking like exercises in a beginning acting class. The overall sentiment was disappointment and a strong recommendation not to waste time watching the movie."
What elements of the film's production made it feel outdated?,"The first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on (unless you read the book - which I had not).<br /><br />If you can stick with the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet none-the-less.<br /><br />The way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80's, not 2005.<br /><br />No stand-out moments, bland, but it moved along without boring me.<br /><br />I would like to know why Keaton selected this role, her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance.","The movie's first 30 minutes were confusing, especially for those unfamiliar with the source material. However, if you push through, the second half offers a sweet, albeit predictable, experience. The film lacked standout moments and the casting choices, particularly with Keaton, felt imbalanced."
Why did Dianne Keaton agree to be a part of this movie?,"As I sat subjected to this televised mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this trash? The movie uses meaningless, contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands. The movie takes a political agenda to a new level. The movie was meaningless, and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype. <br /><br />It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile, but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you cannot polish a turd. I hope that you did not waste your New Year's Day watching another mindless made for TV movie. I now know why the networks started airing series on Sunday night, to rid us of trash!","The movie is filled with meaningless plot lines, a forced political agenda, and excessive use of stereotypes, making it a complete waste of time. Even Dianne Keaton's performance couldn't salvage this terrible excuse for entertainment."
What aspects of the movie made it boring and poorly acted?,"My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started out well; but, soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while. It got so bad that we turned it off The movie was poorly acted and honesty, we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning. I would have had her committed. And, of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood we have to throw it a token ""gay"" character! This movie was boring. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!","The movie was a major disappointment considering the anticipation my wife and I had at the beginning. While it initially seemed warm and touching, it quickly turned boring and frankly idiotic. The poor acting and the unrealistic behavior of the main character made it hard to keep watching. It was hard to sympathize with her after witnessing her rude and strange actions. Additionally, the inclusion of a token ""gay"" character felt forced and unnecessary. Overall, the movie fell short of expectations and I was left wanting more, especially from acclaimed actress Diane Keaton."
What are some flaws in the movie's plot and character development?,"Slow, Slow, Slow... There is no mystery or excitement in this film. If you don't figure out who the ""mole"" is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead. The secret service must have been too, because it took them the whole film to put it together. There are no compelling characters in the movie (not film). The pace of the movie is slow there is no tension. The hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at Michael Douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass. The funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending. It is laugh out loud ridiculous. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would have joined them if I were not sitting in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this film to anyone.","The movie is incredibly slow-paced with no mystery or excitement. The ""mole"" is so easy to figure out that it makes the Secret Service look incompetent. The characters are not compelling, and even the hired killer's accuracy is laughable when aiming at the main character. The ending is anticlimactic and ridiculous, causing multiple people to leave the movie early."
What are some of the major flaws in the movie?,"Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible. It carries no semblance of a genuine human story, dead and dull. It is a parody of Hollywood, with trumpet musical bits that remind you of a Denzel Washington movie, wobbly camera shots and focusing, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalogue poses. It is made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from watching celebrity names. The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot for watching this, save yourself.","Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible. It carries no semblance of a genuine human story, dead and dull.

What are some of the major flaws in The Sentinel movie according to the reviewer?,"There is good. There is bad. And then their is The Sentinel, a bottom-barrel political ""thriller"" that ranks among the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is a good one, but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered. Directed with ham-handed ""edginess"" by Clark Johnson, every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say I have NEVER, in all my life, viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes. The twist is predictable from square one, and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value.","The Sentinel is a disaster of a film that fails to live up to its potential. The plot is promising but poorly executed, with lackluster direction and uninspired performances from the cast. Michael Douglas appears disengaged, and the storyline is riddled with gaping plot holes. The twist is easily foreseen, and the character motivations are laughably absurd. It's best to steer clear of this film as it offers no positive aspects and falls short in every aspect."
What are some examples of movies similar to this one that the reviewer suggests might also be enjoyed?,"Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.<br /><br />Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.","The reviewer has a very negative opinion about this movie, describing it as poorly edited, lacking in cinematography, with unintelligent dialogue, and aimless directing. The reviewer also believes the movie is pointless, lame, dumb, and random, advising viewers that it might be the dumbest thing they ever see."
What were the main flaws of the movie according to the review?,"I've been willing to put up with a lot from late-spring/summer action fluff movies, but in general that's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff (i.e. cool special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, had none of this. All that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of Eva Longoria's cleavage (an issue of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I would get into specifics, but quite frankly I've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the movie.<br /><br />The entire time I was in the theater, I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on DVD. Save your money on this one, folks. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria's cleavage.","The movie was criticized for lacking plot, suspense, character development, and continuity. The reviewer felt that the cheap thrill of Eva Longoria's cleavage was not enough to make up for the movie's shortcomings, and recommended saving money by not watching it unless one was solely interested in that aspect."
What are some elements of the movie that were deemed unconvincing or nonsensical by the reviewer?,"A bum gives a Secret Serviceman a tip about a Secret Service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. Baloney. How did the bum know? The script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the Secret Service works, but who cares. Most of this just slows down the movie. All the chases that follow are this film's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies. Then, after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out-guns all his buddies, we have a shootout in the Toronto City Hall. The Canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs, but how did they get into this? Finally, all is worked out. But it still makes no sense.","The reviewer found the premise of a bum giving a tip to a Secret Serviceman about a plot to kill the president to be unbelievable. They also criticized the over-detailed focus on the workings of the Secret Service, considering it to be unnecessary and dragging down the movie's pace. The reviewer further disapproved of the repetitive and unexciting chase scenes and the shootout at Toronto City Hall involving Canadians that seemed out of place. Overall, they concluded that the resolution of the movie failed to bring clarity or logical coherence to the storyline."
What motivated Pete to not help save William's life in the movie?,"SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! Personally I don't understand why Pete did not help to save Williams life,I mean that would be great to know why William was motivated,or forced.I think Secret Service members are every day people,and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the Secret Service,now he's motivations are clear,well known.But as a rental this film will not satisfy you,cause the old but used twists,the average acting -these are just things in this film,only for keep you wait the end.Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did a far better work like this time,and I still wondering how the producers (for example Michael Douglas)left this film to theaters.","The movie fails to provide a clear explanation for Pete's actions and leaves the audience unsatisfied. The plot contains overused twists, and the average acting does not add anything special to the film. Comparing it to other works by the director, such as S.W.A.T., this movie falls short, raising questions about how it made it to theaters."
What sets Hollow Point apart from other films in the genre?,"The director Sidney J. Furie has created in Hollow Point a post-modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. <br /><br />Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterisation' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason'. <br /><br />The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher.<br /><br />One and a half stars.<br /><br />P.S. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane.","Hollow Point undoubtedly stands out from other films in its genre by challenging conventional storytelling elements and creating a post-modern absurdist masterpiece that keeps the audience surprised and engaged. The director's bold decision to strip away traditional plot and character development creates a unique viewing experience that pushes the boundaries of cinema, making it a must-watch for those seeking something different."
What do you think about the lack of humor and absurd situations in the movie?,"This bomb is just one 'explosion' after another, with no humor and only absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strong points. I give it a 1 out of 10. I would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But then at times we all need to have money. And I still recoil at that Tim Burton farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey. But if that was a turkey, this movie then is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, ""give me back my money"". You can bet I would if I could. But that is the trouble with premium services, the subscription variety.",
Have you ever watched a movie that pleasantly surprised you? What about it stood out to you?,"I saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals, where we would set out to rent a bunch of B-movies and vote for who picked the worst.<br /><br />The night we watched this, it was voted the best, due to semblance of plot and fun costuming.<br /><br />This is certainly a silly, kitschy, movie, to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low-budget fluff. Personally, however, I wouldn't recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave it's own mark on you.<br /><br />It made enough of an impression on me that I've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years.<br /><br />A good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies. This one is fun, and I remember bouncy music ...","It's been years since I first saw this movie during a group movie night, and it still holds a special place in my memory. The low-budget nature adds to its charm, and the semblance of a plot along with fun costuming make it an entertaining watch. I've been searching for a copy of this movie for years now, that's how much of an impression it made on me. Overall, if you're looking for a fun, kitschy movie to enjoy with friends, this is a great choice."
What makes the movie somewhat watchable despite its flaws?,"This film is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. But it's so campy it's actually semi-watchable. That's SEMI watchable.<br /><br />The storyline (what little there is) makes virtually no sense whatsoever. The Barney Drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /><br />Many of the Canadian supporting cast can be found in TV commercials.. None of them went on to anything else that I'm aware of. And of course Sly Stallone's even less talented brother well..... =\<br /><br />Trivia: It was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles N.east of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished ""Oshawa Drive-in"" just before it was torn down.","The film is poorly acted, written, directed, and produced, with a confusing storyline that lacks sense. The only comic relief comes from the Barney Drum character, which quickly becomes tiresome. The Canadian supporting cast, largely unknown, only went on to star in TV commercials, and the movie features Sly Stallone's less talented brother."
Can you explain why Glenn Close's performance as Cruella de Vil stands out in 102 Dalmatians?,"102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) <br /><br />Believed to be cured, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life. Things are going well for Cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street. When the clock strikes on Big Ben, things turn bad. The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted.<br /><br />Glenn Close reprises her role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the highlight of the film. Every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel, which feels more of a repeat of the previous film, rather than a new story.<br /><br />She's Changed.  Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)","Despite Glenn Close's captivating performance, 102 Dalmatians falls short as a sequel by offering a repetitive storyline that lacks originality and fails to engage the audience. The film struggles to establish a new narrative and instead relies heavily on the success of its predecessor, resulting in a dull viewing experience."
What kind of audience would this movie not be suitable for?,"I wouldn't bring a child under 8 to see this. With puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child. <br /><br />The live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kids.<br /><br />I don't know what the Disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level. The puppies are cute But this movie is spotty at best.","The movie may not be suitable for young children under 8 years old due to scenes involving suspense, dangerous situations, and a more ominous feel compared to the cartoon version. Some moments may be disquieting and could potentially worry or frighten small kids. The story and acting were not up to Disney's usual level, making the movie spotty at best."
What aspects of the movie were criticized in the negative review?,"...because this was simply awful. 101 Dalamatians was funny even if formulaic, but this is nothing more than puerile drivel. The same plot except with the story excised from it; the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw; Tim McInnerny proving that he really can't do comedy (everone remembers Percy in Blackadder but that was his high spot - it's all been downhill since then); direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again - properly this time. Ieuan Grufford better go back to Hornblower sharpish, whilst Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years.<br /><br />Perhaps I could be too harsh; after all I didn't manage to sit through the whole film. It gets 1/10; only because I can't give it 0.","The negative review criticized the recycled plot, the annoying character of the intelligent macaw, Tim McInnerny's lackluster performance, poor direction, and the suggestion for some actors to go into hiding."
Was the film engaging and effective in keeping the viewers interested?,"This film was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for x-amount of minutes, I was wondering when the film was going to start. All the setups were in place; typical love story, characters have to overcome their short-givings, villain has to emerge, but none of it ever initiated. By the time these things happened, I was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it felt like necessary frames were cut. Kid's stuff does not have to be this way. Children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones. The excuse, ""hey , its for kids,"" is bull. I'll take ""Sword in the Stone"" any day. This was terrible. I'm getting the feeling that Disney will put out anything these days. And as for the kids, the 10-year I saw this with will agree...pure trash.","The film was a complete bore, with setups that took too long to get to the point, failing to create the tension and excitement needed to captivate the audience. It felt like crucial parts were missing, making the whole experience underwhelming and ineffective."
What are some standout features of this film that contribute to its poor quality?,"Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, please never let<br /><br />him direct again. Timing, pacing, editing: all hopelessly wrong.<br /><br />Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, walk off the<br /><br />set) can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like Alice<br /><br />Evans, and the kind of production standards you'd expect from<br /><br />teen-produced children's shows on british TV.<br /><br />Greatest mystery: the music. A score so inept, inappropriate and<br /><br />ill-matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is<br /><br />a case of sabotage. Add an acoustic that booms apparently<br /><br />unengineered from a single mike, and a director who only<br /><br />intermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen, and we<br /><br />have what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result of<br /><br />recent years.","The director, Kevin Lime, failed to execute proper timing, pacing, and editing in this film, resulting in a production filled with amateurish standards reminiscent of children's TV shows. Additionally, the music score was inappropriate and poorly matched with the tone of the film, leading one to wonder if it was intentional sabotage."
Can you describe the problems with the plot and character development in the movie?,"This sequel is thoroughly uneven, incoherent and rambling in ""plot"" (if there really is one)and tries too damned hard to be modern (ridiculous, out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate) and cute (yawn: there are too many manufactured, belaboured jokes with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and she is normally very good) sweeps through this film, parodying herself as the original De Ville and the lead from Sunset Boulevard! It's a film that isn't even good to look at. This is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, characterisation and acceptable acting. This doesn't. It is bad.","The sequel appears disorganized, lacks coherence and is filled with forced modern elements like 21st-century style songs that seem out of place. The movie also relies too heavily on animal jokes, caricaturing even seasoned actors like Glenn Close. The overall experience is far from enjoyable, making it a clear example of a pointless and poorly executed sequel."
What are some of the drawbacks of the movie perceived by viewers?,"Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point, we only wait until she starts having crises. Soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. That is fair enough as its target market is, I assume, children under 12. Quite a good entertainment for children and families, but didn't do much for me. * out of *****","The plot of 101 Dalmatians is quite predictable, following the typical storyline of a villain creating havoc and the heroes trying to save the day. The characters besides Cruella DeVil, played by Glen Close, are portrayed in a silly and over-the-top manner, which may not resonate well with adult viewers. The film seems to primarily target children under 12, leaving older audiences feeling less entertained and engaged. Overall, while it may be a fun watch for kids and families, the lack of depth in the storyline and character development may leave some viewers wanting more substance."
What aspects of the book were poorly represented in the movie?,"I watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on. I blame this on poor screenplay and direction. Some parts were forcibly introduced (the gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after watching the movie and some 20 years or so after reading it for the first time. I found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all... other than sensational parts for the time. As it covers stuff that was deemed 'sensitive', to say the least, during communism, I can see the fascination it produced at the time. That isn't the case anymore though or maybe I see things differently now or a bit of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book, the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book. Even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made.","The film poorly resembles the book it is based on due to a weak screenplay and direction. Forceful inclusion of certain scenes like the gay rape scene seemed unnecessary. The execution of the story felt clumsy with too many unrelated ideas introduced just for shock value. The film tried to cover too much from the book, resulting in a confusing concoction of scenes that made it hard to watch."
What are some of the notable flaws of this movie?,"Although I recently put this on my 10 worst films list, I have to say it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in ""The Maddening"" or any of the ""Look Who's Talking"" sequels. Still, it's pretty nauseating, even with sexy Drew Barrymore playing something of a horror-movie answer to Holly Golightly, relocating from New York City to Los Angeles but finding out she's being stalked by a murderous look-alike. Poor Sally Kellerman, a quirky actress of great acclaim in the '70s, is reduced here to a paltry supporting role, and Barrymore's leading man George Newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor, always pausing for a laugh after every line. The picture is swill, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship, and the identity of the psycho (although right out of a ""Scooby Doo"" episode) is interesting. But as for the finale...get real! Who had to clean up THAT mess? * from ****","This movie falls into the category of films that are hard to enjoy, even with Drew Barrymore in a sexy role and an interesting psycho reveal. The characters lack depth, the leading man's performance feels exaggerated, and the finale is unrealistic. Overall, the film's attempt at combining horror and thriller elements falls flat, making it a disappointing watch."
Can you tell me about a movie that was a complete waste of time?,"I was interested in the topic, and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dancing on David Letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it. OK, she shows some breast (or maybe a body double does). The plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible. Neither lead has any material to work with, as the direction of the film leads nowhere. Don't waste your time. See Donnie Darko instead if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore film, and if you want to see another, skip this and see Darko again.<br /><br />The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well. Refer to Charles Williams' novel ""Descent Into Hell"" for something worth considering instead. This is just an excuse to make a B film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at Blockbuster.<br /><br />What makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy? Give me a break.","This movie was a disaster. The plot was all over the place, the acting was horrendous, and it seemed like the entire direction of the film was a dead end. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. The treatment of the Doppelganger legend was poorly done, and the acting was far from praiseworthy. Just watch something else instead."
What is the central plot of the movie and how is Drew Barrymore's performance portrayed?,"Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt.<br /><br />After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah Drew, that's hot! <br /><br />Best scene just might be where Drew stabs her real-life Mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife... hmmm... and how was your day?","The central plot of the movie revolves around Drew Barrymore's character encountering her alter-ego all over town, but it fails to capture interest or deliver any scares. Drew's performance is highlighted as sexy and appealing, especially during a scene where she confidently stands up to rude construction workers. However, the film lacks depth and fails to create a truly engaging or thrilling experience for the audience."
What are some major drawbacks of the movie in terms of its acting and dialogue?,"I have just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies. <br /><br />The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from NYC to LA in order to get over her recently troubled loss. Short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin=doppelganger, who haunts her.<br /><br />The movie is quite poor and lousy. Both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it. Summing up it is just something for the fans of Drew Barrymore.",
What is the movie about?,"I got the DVD very cheap and I'm a total Drewbie, and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone.<br /><br />An early Drew movie, she's looking great, and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a number of sexy outfits etc. She does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies.<br /><br />The movie itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more looking like being made for the TV than one for the cinema. There is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy.<br /><br />The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly don't understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you don't get the end you would be expecting, and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected.<br /><br />Overall I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.","The movie seems to primarily appeal to hardcore fans of Drew Barrymore, as it showcases her in various alluring scenes but lacks depth and fails to deliver in terms of plot and tension. The ending is confusing and comes abruptly, leaving viewers disappointed."
What are some of the flaws in the movie?,"Even in a bad film, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply terrible all over. The acting was laughable, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable Breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were shoddy at best. This was a very bad film and one that even Drew Barrymore wishes was expunged from history. Watch it if you want to: a) Suffer harsh self inflicted pain. b) See just how bad a film can be. This is one film where I can use the cliché ""there's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back"" with some justification!","The movie was a complete disaster with laughable acting, a terrible script filled with inexplicable references, and shoddy special effects. It's so bad that even Drew Barrymore wishes it was erased from existence. Watching this film will make you wish for a time machine to reclaim the wasted 90 minutes of your life."
What was your overall impression of the movie?,"Dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to ""get started""... then I waited for it to redeem itself... and when it did neither, I just sat there, dumbfounded that: 1) it could possibly be this bad, and 2) that I had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity. I had faith that Drew couldn't possibly have made this bad of a movie... and boy, did I ever lose my faith! Don't bother with this one! Drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly conceived! I can't believe a script this bad ever got funded! It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea, (the word ""concept"" is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) and it STILL didn't go anyplace! Its just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst, baffles me! Because believe me, if it got any worse I'd have slit my wrists before finishing it!","This movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. The storyline was weak, the acting was subpar, and the entire concept was poorly executed. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching such a poorly made film. It lacked any redeeming qualities and left me feeling utterly disappointed."
Would you recommend this movie to someone looking for a well-developed plot and funny jokes?,"Although it's an R rated movie, I really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a teenager<br /><br />Why? Because there's no real plot, no character development,no funny jokes. <br /><br />The only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks (pretty nice ones I might add) to feast your eyes on.<br /><br />I really can't understand why this movie has the American Pie title since it's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them.<br /><br />My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks, but you're too shy to rent/buy an erotic movie. <br /><br />Gave it 1/10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2/10 for the nice chicks","The movie lacks a real plot, character development, and humor, with the only highlight being the abundance of nudity, making it more like a failed attempt at mixing eroticism and comedy rather than succeeding at either."
What are some flaws in the movie that you noticed?,"American Pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first i believe the actors don't have a clue what their doing and instead it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts. Story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie. In fact they didn't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film.<br /><br />Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free. But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking. I'm a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty would've been a better choice instead.","The movie American Pie is a disappointment compared to the original. The plot is shallow, focusing on college party cliches rather than genuine storytelling. The lack of depth and overemphasis on gratuitous sex and alcohol scenes make it seem like a brainless film aimed at sensationalism rather than substance. It fails to capture the charm of the original American Pie and misses the mark with its uninspired content."
Would you recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good comedy film to watch?,"OK so there's nudity, but hey, there's free porn on the internet for whomever likes it. And its just silly how they forced tits into every frame. I mean i was embarrassed, not from the nudity but from the far-fetchessness of the producers/writers of this piece of crap.<br /><br />The movie is NOT funny at all, its just extremely predictable all the time. There is no plot, no dramatic content at all. This is way waay worse then the other pie-films and they arnt that great either:) If you're really drunk or maybe a 13 year old buy who are really obsessed with tits this might be acceptable, otherwise not. <br /><br />May it forever roth align with crap of the same magnitude with regards Erik the questmaster flash MC",
What are some shortcomings of the film?,"This was the worst film i have seen for a long time. <br /><br />Not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /><br />The girls are nice though, but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film.<br /><br />This film seems to be a very bad made sex ad, made for an audience that is not older than 12.<br /><br />I never visited an American college, but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes.<br /><br />Save your time, do something else.","The film lacked the humor and depth typically found in the American Pie movies, and instead focused too much on cheap sexual content that failed to entertain. The storyline was predictable and lacked substance, making it a disappointment compared to its predecessors. The film seemed more like a poorly made advertisement for sex rather than a genuine comedy, catering to a younger audience with its juvenile humor. The overall viewing experience was unfulfilling and I would recommend finding something else to watch."
What is your opinion on the latest installment in the American Pie series?,"Another American Pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all. It doesn't deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at ""The Wedding"".<br /><br />This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title American Pie on. When i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series. It doesn't fell like American Pie at all. It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other American Pie movies.<br /><br />I don't recommend it ever. Actually i don't recommend any of the ""American Pie Presents"" movies. Just stick with the nice original trilogy.<br /><br />2/10","This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title American Pie on.

What makes American Pie: Beta House such a disappointing movie?,"Just finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I gotta say, this was such a garbage pile of crap. The first 3 American Pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie.<br /><br />As you figured out from the title of the movie, Beta House, is about a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of them all, falling in love. Of course, the guy that has his way with the chicks is Stifler, who, along with his mates, tries to complete another apparently impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. Its just really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To sum it up: awful acting + dull script + wrong use of the American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give it a two out of ten, although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls, like 2 funny scenes :)","One viewer expressed disappointment in the film, mentioning how the last few American Pie movies were lacking compared to the earlier ones, with Beta House being particularly bad. The reviewer criticized the weak and predictable plot, the unrealistic and fake elements, as well as the poor acting and lackluster script. They felt the movie was a total waste of time, despite some nudity and pretty girls, with only a couple of mildly funny scenes."
What are some significant drawbacks of the latest American Pie movie?,"well its official. they have just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been awful. I mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses, I mean come on talk about a weak plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society.<br /><br />The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know its hard trying to compare yourself with the Steven Stifler but so no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there is 2-3 funny bits in the film.<br /><br />The best character in this movie of course is Jim's dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films.","The reviewer expressed disappointment in the weak plot centered around college fraternities battling each other, contrasting it with the more meaningful themes of growing up and marriage in the earlier films. They criticized the portrayal of the new Stifler and highlighted that the only redeeming quality was Jim's dad."
"What are some major flaws you found in the movie ""BETA HOUSE""?","I have to say that I used to be a huge fan of the series. The first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse. I know they are made for DVD films but some effort would be nice.<br /><br />There are no laughs, just a couple of good one-liners that will bring a smile if that. There is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks. But neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work.<br /><br />To add to all that this is a RACIST film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist. I am NOT one of those people who think everything should be politically correct. But the portrayal of minorities is very offensive.<br /><br />I wouldn't waste any time on this garbage. See the previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.","The movie ""BETA HOUSE"" is a huge disappointment, especially for fans of the series. It fails to deliver any laughs, with only a few mediocre one-liners scattered throughout. The attempt at humor falls flat, and even the nudity and attractive actors can't save it. Additionally, the film comes across as racist, with offensive portrayals of minorities that make it hard to watch without feeling uncomfortable. Overall, ""BETA HOUSE"" is a complete letdown and not worth anyone's time."
Was the movie lacking a coherent plot and characterized by derogatory stereotypes?,"To summarize this movie: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just awful, the humor isn't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me, that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy, who thinks that drinking is cool, women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks. Also, the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies, other than a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this one. The only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls. Don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above 2.",
How does this film compare to Castle of Cagliostro?,"This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting. <br /><br />The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging. <br /><br />Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /><br />The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.","This film falls short when compared to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin's character lacks the humor and energy seen in the latter. The setting and music lack creativity and the plot fails to captivate the audience. The only highlight is the nudity, which adds some excitement to an otherwise dull movie. Characters like Zenigata, Goemon, and Jigen lack the charm they usually bring. The DVD has some bonus features, but the lack of chapter selection is a drawback."
What are some elements in the movie that the reviewer found disappointing?,"I know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality, but this one got on my nerves. It perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about ""psychological trauma"" and mental illness. The ""psycho mom"" thing has been done too many times before (and usually done better) and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched as well. The acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />One highlight: I am a long-time fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former GH regular, Jon Lindstrom.<br /><br />Anyway, if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it, in the same way a person must suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie might be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards.<br /><br />I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.","The movie perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about psychological trauma and mental illness, the plot is far-fetched, and the acting is nothing to rave about. The portrayal of the ""psycho mom"" trope has been overused and done better in other films."
What are some aspects of the movie that could have been improved upon?,"If you have plenty of time to waste ... it's OK. It moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter. <br /><br />The acting is OK. Mariana Klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most believable.<br /><br />William R. Moses played a pretty good part as the husband.<br /><br />Gail O'Grady, as the wife, had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed.<br /><br />The ending is sort of silly. Like most of these sitter movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time.","The movie moves at a good pace but lacks in providing sufficient background on the characters, particularly the sitter. The acting is mediocre overall, with only Mariana Klaveno standing out. William R. Moses delivers a decent performance, but Gail O'Grady's role feels weak and underdeveloped. The ending is deemed silly and overall, the movie leaves viewers questioning their time spent watching it."
What are some memorable moments in the movie that add to its entertainment value?,"this movie delivers. the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he's never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off.<br /><br />but this movie doesn't stop there, when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer. <br /><br />stereotypical grilling dads, several plot lines that go nowhere, and a former seaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect Saturday night at home.","The movie captures various comical scenes, from an awkward teenage neighbor struggling to ride a bike to a humorous moment of someone trying to take a beer from a cooler. Additionally, it includes stereotypical grilling dads, unresolved plotlines, and a nod to a former seaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone, making it a fun choice for a Saturday night at home.

"Can you explain why ""There's a Girl in My Soup"" might not be worth watching?","I read that ""There's a Girl in My Soup"" came out during Peter Sellers's low period. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Seemingly, the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the movie; it doesn't. The whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything. Maybe I haven't seen every movie about middle-aged to elderly people trying to be hippies, but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name.<br /><br />All in all, both Sellers and Hawn have starred in much better movies than this, so don't waste your time on this. Pretty worthless.","The movie lacks a compelling storyline and seems to rely on the star power of Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn, but ultimately falls flat. The overall lack of substance and direction in the film can make it a disappointing watch."
What elements of the movie failed to impress the reviewer?,"Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after her Oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud. As a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's, Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.<br /><br />A 3 out of 10. Best performance = ? Nicky Henson plays a young study type.<br /><br />I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well, because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - CATCH-22, M.A.S.H., HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others). You can't win them all!","Peter Sellers is mildly amusing in this film, however, the script is deemed as extremely lame and insulting. Goldie Hawn's performance is not seen as enough to salvage the movie from being a disaster. Sellers' character as a skirt-chasing celebrity comes off as embarrassing. The reviewer rates the movie 3 out of 10 and points out that there were far better films released in the same year."
What elements of GEORGE 2 made it such a disappointment compared to the first movie?,"Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently, but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end. Just awful! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. There's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this. GEORGE 2 is probably the single worst sequel I have ever seen, and that is saying something. Jeez, because of IMDb's 10 lines rule, I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-TV sequel. Disney, hang your head in shame.","The reviewer found GEORGE 2 to be an awful sequel with shoddy direction and editing, lackluster performances from the lead characters, and a forgettable plot. The movie felt like watching deleted scenes, and even the return of the original voice of Ape the Ape did not redeem it. The reviewer considers GEORGE 2 to be the worst sequel they have ever watched and seem very disappointed in the overall quality of the film."
What aspects of the movie disappointed the reviewer?,"When I go to see movies I would stay up and watch it or if I did not like it, I would go sleep, but this was pure crap, I actually got up and walked out!....This was poorly script and put together, I hated it. Also, they should not have taken Brendan Frasier off, he was much better. This was not as good as I had expected, considering that I really liked George of The Jungle 1, and the graphics weren't as good as the first one, for instance, the bird, and when ever he crashed in a tree. I hope that the director of this takes heed, and next movies he make, he needs to reconsider...horrible! I really would like to give Ursla a job well done, as she made the movie worthwhile (until I walked out)...overall I give this movie a 2 out of 10","The reviewer was extremely disappointed with the movie, stating that it was poorly scripted and put together. They felt it was not as good as they had expected, especially compared to the previous film in the series. The reviewer also mentioned that they walked out of the movie, indicating their strong dislike for it."
What were the major drawbacks of the sequel to George of the Jungle according to the reviewer?,"This movie was on t.v the other day, and I didn't enjoy it at all. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel.... completely awful. The new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all, they should of had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and original actress (i forgot her name) so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating, not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy, this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought. It was good to see Ape the ape back, but wasn't as fun as the first, they should of had the new George as Georges son grown up, and still had Bredon and (whats her face) in the film, that would've been a bit better then it was.","The sequel to George of the Jungle was deemed a disappointment by this viewer. The new actors did not impress, with the absence of the original lead actors Brendon Fraiser and the actress contributing to the overall lack of enjoyment. The movie was described as completely awful with a 0 out of 10 rating, making it difficult to sit through and enjoy. The potential storyline featuring George's son grown up was highlighted as a missed opportunity for a better plot."
What is the main issue with the movie?,"Let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator:Huh? Wait a minute! Who the heck are you? George: Me new George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the part? George: New George just lucky, I guess. <br /><br />Sadly, that's the only funny part in the entire movie.<br /><br />It was still entertaining...But then again, i'm easily entertained...<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is the worst movie i've ever seen (that title goes to the terribly un-funny Disaster Movie...), This movie falls #7 on my bottom 15 list...<br /><br />If your a small child who is easily entertained, you'll enjoy this movie. If you're a movie-watcher who wants a good, funny movie, You'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one..","The main issue with this movie is that, aside from one humorous moment at the start, there is a lack of funny moments throughout the rest of the film. It may be able to mildly entertain those who are easily amused, but for viewers seeking genuinely funny content, this movie falls short and can be quite disappointing."
What aspects of the movie's plot were straightforward?,"Well I watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward. There was no beating around the bush that this kid was the Anti-Christ. However the movie was just poorly written. For example, they never explained how they made the dentist incident an ""Accident"" or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet. The death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all. The kid they chose to play the Anti-Christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid. Just don't waste your time watching this.","The movie lacks coherent explanations for key events, such as the dentist incident and the cop's timing, and the chosen actor for the Anti-Christ role came off as boring. The death scenes were poorly executed and failed to captivate the audience. Overall, the movie was poorly written and not worth watching."
What made this movie incredibly boring and lacking sense in the plot according to the reviewer?,"Normally I would never rent a movie like this, because you know it's going to be bad just by looking at the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home I found out the videostore-guy gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lame movie.<br /><br />This movie is incredibly boring, the acting is bad and the plot doesn't make any sense. It's hard to write a good review, because I have no idea what the movie was really about. At the end of the movie you have more questions then answers.<br /><br />On 'Max Power's Scale of 1 to 10' I rate this movie: 1<br /><br />PS I would like to correct Corinthian's review (right below mine). He says Robert Englund is ripping off lingerie, riding horses naked, etc. The guy that did those things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not by Robert Englund.","The movie was incredibly boring, had bad acting, and a nonsensical plot, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. The reviewer struggled to understand what the movie was really about and rated it a mere 1 out of 10."
What are some common elements that you feel filmmakers should avoid in order to make their movies more family-friendly?,"Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This came on at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon and I couldn't believe what they showed. Thank God my son was outside or I would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft/medium porn! Do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt? Kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show???!!! The acting was good and I enjoyed the suspense but GEE! There was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie. Randy Travis was really good in his role. If the writers, directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes. What has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction? Where can I complain?","This movie showcased good acting and built suspense effectively, with expected violence and antagonists in a western setting. However, the excessive nudity and sex scenes crossed a line, making it inappropriate for viewing by a wider audience. The explicit content could potentially offend or corrupt viewers, especially those who prefer family-friendly entertainment. The focus on these unnecessary scenes detracted from the overall enjoyment and quality of the film."
What were the main aspects that disappointed you about the movie?,"I'm surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks. My thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male. Whipped and tortured women, merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients, introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre. The opening and the hand-smashing are DJANGO rip-offs. THE SHOOTER however lacks the style of e.g. DJANGO. Score, acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here. And the actors don't have an Italian accent.<br /><br />4 / 10.","The film received a low rating of 4/10 mainly due to its lack of style compared to similar films like DJANGO, along with mediocre score, acting, and cinematography. The themes of whipped and tortured women, merciless revenge, and a high body count did not compensate for these shortcomings."
What does this movie have in terms of content that might not appeal to everyone?,"A cast of 1980's TV movie and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley,Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models. Of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications.<br /><br />Over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest. This is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name of Skinamax. I really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there. (I also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking, to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up)","The movie is filled with excessive nudity and violence, lacking substance to maintain viewer interest beyond that. It's reminiscent of the type of film that earned Cinemax the nickname ""Skinamax"", with a plot that might only be appealing to those seeking out every seedy thriller available. Additionally, the exaggerated amount of smoking in the film becomes comical rather than adding to the atmosphere."
What are some major flaws of the movie and why does the reviewer seem unimpressed?,"Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect ""catch"" by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? He's a ""hero"" whom it's very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. However, it's troubles don't end there. It has the production values of a TV-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that I can't reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows. (*1/2)","The reviewer found the main character unlikable and unrelatable, the production values lacking with noticeable flaws, and criticized the ending for being unsatisfactory and unrealistic."
What unrealistic element in the movie disappointed the reviewer?,"The worst kind of film. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museum's security for several days. Eh?<br /><br />The plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery, assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current, which it wouldn't.<br /><br />It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but that system wouldn't fit into the case. Sorry to be anal, but this isn't even close to being plausible. The rest of the film wasn't a great deal better and I'm left wondering why the budget couldn't have been donated to charity or me.",The reviewer was disappointed by the unrealistic premise in the movie where a plasma screen replaced the US Declaration of Independence and fooled the museum's security for several days. The reviewer found this scenario implausible due to the technical details and raised concerns about the overall quality of the film.
What did the reviewer find lacking in Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rochester in this adaptation?,"This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester's character. I get the feeling he never even read the book, just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read ""Grumpy, broody, murky past."" He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave. GO AND REREAD THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND BY THE WAY: A ""PASSIONATE"" LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO EAT HER FACE.","The reviewer found Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rochester to lack nuance and depth, criticizing his performance as over-the-top and devoid of chemistry with the other characters. The reviewer also expressed disappointment in the adaptation's departure from the subtlety of the classic original work by Charlotte Bronte."
What was disappointing about the 1983 adaptation of the movie?,"I've probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I just didn't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars. A lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me, and what was all that about putting Tim in the role of Rochester. Had the casting director actually ever read the book. Very strange! He's a fine actor but Mr. Rochester he definitely isn't! And Zelah was just, well, strange, bit of a mix matched couple. In it's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation, but overall didn't capture any of the magic of the novel. Certainly wouldn't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real let down!","The chemistry between the main stars was lacking, the casting choices were questionable, and the overall adaptation failed to capture the magic of the novel."
Can you tell me about the movie 'Xplosive Angle'?,"I think that if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of English to come up with a script, it would make more sense than this. I could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film. This sounds really mean, but I'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess (see what I did there?) neither the skills to act or to write anything, ever.<br /><br />Watch this only if you're incredibly drunk, high or in need of a good excuse as to why your decaying corpse was found with slit wrists. I will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom. After that, I will mould it into the shape of a disc and put it into my DVD player, fully expecting it to produce something far better than this trumpery.<br /><br />Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL/10 Breasts - 9/10","The movie 'Xplosive Angle' is a complete disaster. The acting is horrendous, it feels like a bunch of amateurs trying to play serious roles. The plot is so nonsensical that it's laughable, you would probably get a better story from a group of elementary students. Avoid watching this movie unless you enjoy torturing yourself."
What can you expect from this horror movie in terms of quality and entertainment value?,"One of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words 'Wanna watch the worst horror movie ever?' I always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes. I had expected your typical cheesy b-slasher but this was beyond B. This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the low. With obviously low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, no plot, really bad so-called 'special effects', shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like House of Wax look like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless - she had some very nice tits. Most of what I said during this film was along the lines of 'Wow this is actually SO BAD', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not drunk enough for this'. So in conclusion: don't waste your time (or money!).","This horror movie is truly a disaster in every aspect, from the poor acting to the nonexistent plot and terrible production quality. It falls into the category of Z-slasher, making it the bottom of the barrel in terms of horror films. The only redeeming quality is a brief moment of nudity, but that alone cannot salvage this trainwreck of a movie. Save yourself the trouble and avoid watching this mess."
What was the biggest disappointment while watching this movie?,"Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live there), and those actors need to find another job. The most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life... and I only kept watching to see if it would get better which, unfortunately for me it did not.<br /><br />Even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a great ""How Not To Make a Movie"" guide. Too bad I can't give a 0.","The movie was a disaster from start to finish. The script was terrible, the acting was abysmal, and there was no redeeming factor to keep me engaged. I wasted my time hoping it would improve, only to be let down all the way to the agonizingly slow credits. This movie serves as a prime example of what not to do when making a film."
"What makes this movie not worth watching, according to this review?","I am a MAJOR fan of the horror genre! I LOVE horror/slasher/gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are the really ""good"" bad horror flicks. But this movies has NOTHING to warrant it's viewing!! I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that's wrong with it.<br /><br />The script is horrid. The acting is horrid. The FX are not even worth discussing. The ""set"" is an absolute JOKE!! The sad thing is I think there MAY be some real potential in a couple of the actors, but this vehicle left them NOTHING to work with!!!<br /><br />Suffice it to say I saw it for ""free"" & feel I was robbed!! The time you'd WASTE watching this would be better spent flossing your cat.","The reviewer criticizes the movie for having a terrible script, acting, and special effects. Additionally, they mention that the set design is laughable and believe that the potential of some actors was wasted due to the poor quality of the movie. They also express feeling like their time was robbed and suggest that watching the film is a waste of time."
What were your expectations going into this movie?,"Well, because I'm a musician I thought, maybe I'll check this movie out on TMC, nothing else good on. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's only half done. I seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting, crappy filming and crappy effects. But nope, I don't even get the pleasure of that. Even the ""musicians"" weren't very good. I was hoping for maybe some laughs, but I wasn't sure if they were attempting to throw in one-liners or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest just until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now i get to sit here typing until i have 10 lines",
What makes 'Savage Island (2003)' a bad movie?,"Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don't know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1.","The movie 'Savage Island (2003)' is described as a low-budget film with poor lighting, bad acting, a terrible storyline, and a wretched script. The reviewer found the situations in the movie to be inane and felt that it was virtually unwatchable. They recommend passing on this movie if you come across it in a rental store."
"What is the main issue with the portrayal of immigrants in the movie ""The Return""?","Just saw the movie this past weekend, I am upset, and disappointed with it. Basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, the ones from former Soviet Union especially, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what Americans have been working for. Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs. The actors did pretty well, but it wasn't up to them save this bunch of crap. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. Couldn't wait to get out of the theater, want my money back.","The movie ""The Return"" delivers a flawed and offensive message about immigrants from the former Soviet Union, portraying them in a negative light as invaders. The overall quality of the writing, directing, and filming is amateurish, despite some decent performances by the actors. The humor falls flat most of the time, leaving the audience eager to leave the theater and regretting spending money on this disappointing film."
What were some of the major flaws in the movie according to the critic's review?,"Evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything. I am not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's B movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse. As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. The English was terribly accented and I think no one could really even speak English they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both ""life-like"" and real.","The special effects were worse than those in 1950's B movies, the acting was subpar with even a child outshining some actors, and the English accents were terribly executed, making the dialogue feel unnatural."
What are some elements of The King Maker that stand out in the film?,"The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. The acting, in particular, was extremely poor. Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. The movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth.<br /><br />Final say? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion. In short, the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script.","Despite the costumes and art direction being praiseworthy, the film fails to leave a lasting impression. The acting is notably subpar, with forced emotional performances and irritating accents. The storyline is deemed too simplistic and lacks the grandeur expected for a historical drama. The execution overall is lacking, leading to the movie feeling more like a failed attempt at creating an Asian version of Elizabeth rather than a compelling narrative."
What elements make this movie fall short despite its potential?,"This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. It almost were. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.","The movie fails to live up to its potential despite a decent budget, beautiful lead actress, and action scenes reminiscent of famous actors and movies. The end result is a dull experience that lacks interest, with one redeeming aspect being an actor trying his best in a poorly executed flying duel scene."
What aspects of the movie were particularly disappointing?,"Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. This was such a bad movie, about such and interesting true story. It had such promise, but the acting was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something out of a theme park. I found myself laughing as I watched, what was suppose to be, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the ""King"" dying. I liked the Queens' punishment. And, the final shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are so many better movies to watch. I don't recommend this.","The movie had an interesting true story at its core, but unfortunately, the potential was not fully realized. The acting was subpar, with some scenes coming across as ridiculous rather than serious. Additionally, the inconsistency in the sets, ranging from beautiful and realistic to resembling something out of a theme park, detracted from the overall experience. While there were a few redeeming moments such as the fight between friends and the final shot, the movie as a whole failed to impress. The viewer is left feeling like there are much better movies out there to watch, making it hard to recommend this one."
Can you elaborate on the specific flaws and inconsistencies in the movie that made it difficult to enjoy as a viewer?,"This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie. Face it, you can't. Because that way there's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot, have meaningless transitions, trite, unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd.<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie, really I did; I like lots of crappy movies. But once I've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and WHY, DEAR LORD, WHY? more than a few times, I really can't take it any more.<br /><br />Also, I would love for someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.","The movie serves as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of attempting to write and direct a film solo. By combining hackneyed plot elements, lackluster transitions, cliched dialogue, it transforms an intriguing Korean legend into a cinematic disaster. The perplexing ending in which LA inexplicably turns into Mordor further adds to the confusion and disappointment for viewers."
What makes a movie like D-Wars such a disappointment to audiences?,"This movie was horrible.<br /><br />They didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly. It was a definite sleeper. You'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but D-Wars surprises you with even a let down in that department. <br /><br />Also, the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick. And I seriously mean that.<br /><br />I was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad!!! Please, whatever you do people, don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.","The characters were underdeveloped, the storyline was poorly executed, the action scenes were lackluster, and the acting was subpar, making it a movie not worth anyone's time or money."
Can you provide a summary of the movie's plot?,"This movie is likely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life -- surpassing the previous most god-awful movie, ""Spawn of Slithis,"" which I saw when I was about 10.<br /><br />Bad acting, stilted and ridiculous dialog, incomprehensible plot, mishmashed cut scenes, even the music was annoying. Did I leave anything out? Well, the special effects weren't bad -- but CGI does not a decent movie make.<br /><br />I can't believe I actually spent money to see this movie. If anyone has the contact info for Hyung-rae Shim (the director), please forward it to my user name ""at gmail,"" and I'll contact him to personally demand a refund.","This movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. The acting was dreadful, the dialogues were stiff and unbelievable, and the storyline was a complete mess. The editing was poorly done, leaving the audience confused and disconnected. The only saving grace was possibly the special effects, but even that wasn't enough to salvage this train wreck of a film. It's hard to believe that people actually paid money to watch this."
What makes this movie a disappointment despite its big budget?,"How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much.","The movie's storyline and dialogue are incredibly amateurish, with characters delivering unrealistic lines and failing to react appropriately. Even with decent lead acting, the poorly written script and subpar performances by supporting actors make the film feel disconnected from reality. The supposed thrilling concept of giant reptiles attacking L.A. falls flat, resulting in a shockingly boring viewing experience."
Can you tell me about the humor in the movie?,"Hilarious, laugh out loud moments ... and yet not a comedy. I particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the ""filthy bum"" who then shouts after them in anger ""you filthy bums"", I mean wow, someone's online degree in literature is paying off! The worst script imaginable, with plot introductions in an instant, ridiculous movement in the story, ZERO character development (even between the characters who meet .. it's as if they all have known and trusted each other for years) dodgy voice over with added echo effects, and plot holes.. oh God are there plot holes!! To be honest I write this not even having watched the entire thing, but I certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of ... well ... use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence!","The movie is filled with absurd, laugh-out-loud moments that are unexpected and entertaining. The humor is cleverly placed throughout the movie, creating a sense of joy and amusement for the viewers."
"Based on the positive reviews above, generate a prompt and a negative review.","This is the sorriest collection of clichés, strung together on a straight line, with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting I've seen in a long time. Canibalising scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence. Was this movie good? It wasn't a movie at all!<br /><br />Even if it doesn't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy, the movie does offer some laughs. The trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films. Gandalf can be funny talking Korean, the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever his name was.<br /><br />Bottom line: any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers, not on the director/writer. Shame on you, Shim!","This movie was a complete disaster, a mash-up of scenes from various successful movies that completely missed the mark in terms of creating a coherent plot or engaging acting. It felt like a cheap imitation that failed to deliver anything original or entertaining. The only saving grace was potentially finding humor in comparing the copied scenes to their original counterparts, but overall, this movie was a huge letdown."
What is missing from the film that negatively impacted the reviewer's opinion?,"First off I'd like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere to be seen in this film. What's a movie without Sam Niel. Did anyone see Event Horizon. D-Wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn't. Nope, no Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent D-Wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a Sam Niel film- apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of Sam Niel movies i recommend<br /><br />-jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red October -event horizon -not jurassic park three<br /><br />overall D-Wars is a pile","The absence of Sam Niel, known for his roles in popular films like Jurassic Park and Event Horizon, significantly hurt the quality of D-Wars according to the reviewer. The reviewer also expressed disappointment in the film's potential not being realized, ultimately deeming it as a poor watch."
What aspects of the movie failed to meet the expectations of the audience and left them dissatisfied?,"Whatever his name is (the writer and director) should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again. This one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they're actually sort of good. Not this one. This was so bad I got angry. Seriously. A drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all, the CGI was barely acceptable, the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was, it's like he just decided, ""I want this to happen and this to happen, but I don't care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. Whatever, I'm going back to my trailer to pick my nose, if anyone calls for me, I'm not here."" Shame on you whatever your name is. Shame on you.","The movie was a complete disaster. The storyline was nonsensical, the acting was lackluster, and the special effects were subpar. It seemed like no effort went into making the film cohesive or engaging. The director's choices for scenes were baffling, making the overall viewing experience frustrating and tedious. It's a shame that such a poorly executed movie was even allowed to be released."
Can you describe the acting in the movie?,"I hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that bad film-making isn't a capital crime or he'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster. I'm amazed that this film had a $75m budget, but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop, that Shim will hopefully, never get to make another movie the rest of the life and, therefore, not waste any more of filmgoers time. I would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now.<br /><br />With the effects resources available to them, a great film could have been made with this budget. As usual, the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story. ""Transformers"" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this makes it look like ""Citizen Kane"".","The acting in this movie was atrocious, with one-dimensional characters and lackluster performances. It seemed like the actors themselves were struggling to believe in the poor script they were given."
What is the main threat in the movie and who is called in to investigate it?,"Based on the Korean legend, unknown creatures will return and devastate the planet. Reporter Ethan Kendrick is called in to investigate the matter, and he arrives at the conclusion that a girl, stricken with a mysterious illness, named Sarah is suppose to help him. The Imoogi makes its way to Los Angeles, wreaking havoc and destruction. With the entire city under arms, will Ethan and Sarah make it in time to save the people of Los Angeles? Written by Anonymous I think he should have included the following<br /><br />This is the worst movie i have ever seen the best actor in the whole thing was the CG dragon and overall it s u c k-ed i am p i s s-ed at not only with the people who made it but myself for watching save yourself the time read a book or something maybe a little Dr Seuss that should be more stimulating.<br /><br />no wonder the guy is anonymous sorry for the format this site has a lot of rules this is the only way i could get this out without adding more","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The best actor in the whole thing was the CG dragon and overall it sucked. I am upset not only with the people who made it but also with myself for watching. Save yourself the time, read a book or something, maybe a little Dr. Seuss, that should be more stimulating."
What was your overall impression of the movie?,"This movie was so very badly written. The characters had no depth. They should have never made a movie of this. My 11 yr old son could write a better screenplay then Hyung-rae Shim.<br /><br />The only actor that didn't suck was the zoo guard. He was the only funny and believable one of the lot.<br /><br />I love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus.<br /><br />For those of you who actually thought this was a good movie, you are in serious need of brain surgery.<br /><br />Most of the creatures in the movie weren't even dragons...so why did they call D-war?","The movie was very poorly written and the characters lacked depth. The only actor who stood out was the zoo guard. Most of the creatures in the movie weren't even dragons, so the title was misleading."
What were some of the major flaws of the movie mentioned in the review?,"this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed. the effects were pretty good- i hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money. i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid, but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back. plot holes abound. terrible acting all across the board. i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to watch this, run away. i can't stress enough how bad this film was. <br /><br />where the hell did the second dragon come from? why didn't he show up sooner? how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?","The reviewer found the movie to be a massive waste of money, citing terrible acting, plot holes, and a second dragon that appeared out of nowhere. They stressed how bad the film was and strongly advised against spending any time watching it."
What age group is the target audience for this movie?,"I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie, as I didn't think it was going to be well done. The kids, ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it, so I caved. I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought, but was still a far cry from the book. The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place. I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the ""silly"" or ""stupid"" choices.","Although the movie may not completely align with the book, it surprisingly resonated well with both a 6-year-old and a 10-year-old in terms of understanding and humor. It also sparked problem-solving discussions among the young viewers."
"Would you recommend ""How to Eat Fried Worms"" to pre-teen kids who enjoy gross-out humor?","Squeamish 11-year-old Luke Benward (as Billy ""Worm Boy"" Forrester) moves to a new town. At his new school, young Benward is picked on by the other boys. They put worms in his thermos. Getting his gag reflex under control, Benward tosses a worm on freckle-faced bully Adam Hicks (as Joe Guire). Benward bets he can eat 10 worms in one day - without regurgitation! <br /><br />Tall, teased Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika ""Erk"" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises, ""No worms were harmed in the making of this movie."" In a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has one funny scene. ""How to Eat Fried Worms"" is loosely based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. Pre-teen kids into gross-outs should enjoy the film.<br /><br />**** How to Eat Fried Worms (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould","The movie ""How to Eat Fried Worms"" follows a young boy who is bullied and dares to eat worms to prove his bravery. The film features a mix of humor and heartwarming moments that are sure to entertain its target audience. With a talented young cast and a lighthearted tone, this movie is a fun watch for kids who enjoy a bit of gross-out humor."
What are some aspects of the movie that make it difficult for adults and teens to enjoy it?,"I was bored, around 10pm, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up. One of the kids had a ring, that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster.<br /><br />It's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms. They act like everything is such a big deal, like if Billy (the main character) doesn't eat the worms then the world will end.<br /><br />This is a good movie for little kids (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis'), but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time.","The movie is full of over-the-top and ridiculous scenes involving young kids acting older than their age, which can be hard to take seriously. The storyline about eating worms is portrayed as if it's the end of the world, making it hard for older audiences to connect with the humor."
What is the main issue with this movie?,"I have to admit I did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching. I watched it with a room full of kids, who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that I grew up with. THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR KIDS! Besides the fact that the content is so crude, the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry. Buy your kids the book instead.","The movie is criticized for being stupid, full of crude humor, and fails to do justice to the original story it is based on. The director's focus on immature and inappropriate content overshadowed the meaningful storyline, making it unsuitable for children. Overall, the film is viewed as a poorly executed adaptation that lacks intelligence and good storytelling."
Can you sell the one star clueless Village Voice a bad movie with misleading tagliner and cheesey music to trick you into buying this movie?,"Trash/bad movies usually ain't bad because I will find them enjoyable. This one is so bad that I am out of words to describe it - its below ""bad"". There is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film. One tagliner compares this one to KILLBILL which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this DVD.<br /><br />If you are considering renting this one, put it down! If you are thinking of buying, Dont think! If you unlucky to have this dvd, dont play it, throw it in trash bin immediately.",
What did the reviewer find disappointing about this particular episode of Scrubs?,"There are no spoilers in this review. There's nothing to spoil.<br /><br />No plot, nothing; most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch, but this didn't even do that. Clips, three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips... OK, so perhaps they were short on production time, but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely. What a waste of time.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this got made, in fact. Scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes, but somehow this got through....<br /><br />Thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode.","The reviewer found the episode to be lacking in plot and substance, with a series of dull and disconnected clips that failed to engage. They expressed confusion as to how the episode was even produced, especially considering the show's usual quality in subverting tropes."
"What inconsistency in the show ""Scrubs"" did the reviewer notice?","The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox shaves his head. The must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it up.","The reviewer pointed out a continuity error in the show ""Scrubs,"" where a character's hairstyle changes unexpectedly due to episodes being shown out of order."
What moments stood out in the movie recap episode?,"I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle ""Coxism State"" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase/or is that Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on Conan). A little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was ""Diner"" by Martin Sexton.","The recap episode was not the most impressive, lacking in engaging content and relying heavily on nostalgic moments. While the change in Cox's character was a refreshing sight, it was only briefly explored. The attempt to identify episodes based on character appearances was interesting but did not add much depth to the viewing experience. The potential comedic downfall of Zach's character was somewhat concerning, and the janitor-induced dance montage, although catchy, was forgettable in the grand scheme of the episode."
What nostalgic feelings did the movie evoke in the reviewer and why?<br />,"But, lets face it... it got a few nostalgic sighs out of me.<br /><br />The show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups. I get a new season, and just power through them like I have 2-days to live. I like the idea of wrapping it up, but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following:<br /><br />Dr.Cox isn't supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes, only explanation I can think of is they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re-shoot the beginning.<br /><br />and that my friends, is why the hell cox is bald.<br /><br />Anyways, the show is awesome...bring on the 7th season.","The movie's consistency allows for overlooking some flaws and just powering through, raising the question of whether the show is truly ending or simply wrapping up with the latest episode. The sudden baldness of a character is noted as a potential continuity error, leaving some viewers puzzled."
Which actress shines in the film despite having limited screen time?,"This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. What she does do however, is shine when she's on screen. The near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some Warner contract players of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the ""go-getter"" with aplomb. Better if this was in color. The Travis Air force base locations with some rear projection work well. What's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. If you enjoyed THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN you'll like this one.","Doris Day's limited presence in the movie doesn't justify her inclusion, but when she appears on screen, she truly stands out. The film's lack of a coherent plot serves mainly as a platform to display various Warner contract players. Janice Rule shows potential and it's a pity she didn't achieve greater fame. Ruth Roman plays her ""go-getter"" role convincingly. The film would have been enhanced if it were in color. The scenes at Travis Air Force base, including some rear projection shots, are effective. The highlight of the movie is the exceptional musical performances. Comparisons to ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" and ""Hollywood Canteen"" suggest that fans of those films will enjoy this one."
Why did this film fail to live up to its potential with a star-studded cast?,"Considering its pedigree, this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is. Even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - the entire event is dully paced, drearily shot and, more often than not, witless.<br /><br />Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comic, as she went on to confirm in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a fine comedian, as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does. Except maybe the cat.","The movie, despite featuring a fantastic cast, was ultimately disappointing due to its dull pacing, uninspired cinematography, and lackluster humor. Kim Novak's comedic talents were evidently not highlighted, and even James Stewart's performance couldn't save the film from being a mess."
"What is the main focus of the movie ""The Border""?","Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico ""Border Cop"". He serves as a father figure to young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be best man at his impending wedding. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) may be tougher. Tough is what you need to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances may be in flux.<br /><br />If you find the possibility of hearing ""Kojak"" and ""Oliver Douglas"" uttering expletives to be repulsive, you ought to steer clear of ""The Border"". If not, you may not have the stomach for the ""realistic"" cow slaughtering scene. Although it doesn't end up being worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /><br />** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert","The movie ""The Border"" features Telly Savalas as a tough US-Mexico border cop who forms a bond with a young immigrant, played by Danny De La Paz. The film delves into themes of loyalty, toughness, and the complexities of border control. Eddie Albert's character adds tension as the boss, and the plot involves a smuggling operation. However, some viewers may be put off by the use of expletives by the main characters and a graphic cow slaughtering scene. Despite some flaws, the standout performances by De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho make the movie engaging."
"What are some common criticisms of the movie ""The Intruder""?","For the big thinkers among us, ""The Intruder"" is a maddeningly incoherent movie from France that gives so-called ""art films"" a bad name. The story is something about a bitter old coot, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes searching in Tahiti for a heart transplant, but beyond that, I have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing. With no coherent storyline to boast of, the movie loses us early on, though I'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be SOMEBODY out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film. <br /><br />This muddled, snail-paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits.","The movie ""The Intruder"" is described as maddeningly incoherent, with a storyline that lacks coherence and leaves viewers confused about the characters and their motives. The pace of the drama is criticized as slow, extending for over two hours, which may deter viewers from staying engaged until the end."
What elements of the movie did the director heavily rely on?,"I'm a big fan of 50s sci-fi, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. It's clear he was working with no money, because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. I have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.<br /><br />There are probably less than 60 seconds of ""blob footage"" in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written, run-on dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good heavens...how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?","The movie heavily relied on the concept rather than the actual execution. The dialogue was bloated and never-ending, with minimal ""blob footage"" and unconvincing casting choices that made it hard to believe the characters were teenagers."
What are some positive aspects of the movie that the critics enjoyed?,When a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight. The only part of this senseless drivel that I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese. This thing actually made 20 million bucks? And McQueen's salary was 3K? All were vastly overpaid. The 'monster' looked a lot like a large beanbag and the 'teens' looked as though they could have children approaching their teen-age years. And those blasts from the shotgun; sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor. The ending was pitifully trite; obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel....and there were many. Thumbs down.,"The movie was a total disaster from start to finish. The plot was ridiculous and made no sense whatsoever. The special effects were laughably bad, especially the ""monster"" that looked more like a large beanbag than a terrifying creature. The casting was completely off, with actors who looked way too old to be playing teenagers. The sound effects were unconvincing, with the blasts from the shotgun sounding like a pellet rifle. The ending was incredibly cliche and clearly just a set up for a sequel. Overall, a huge thumbs down from me."
What kind of movie is this?,"Do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the ""idealistic youths"" of the '60s were reading Marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in grade school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools, who would believe anything as long as it was destructive.<br /><br />This is just another excercise in self-importance from the kids who never really grew up.","This movie is just another exercise in self-importance from the supposedly idealistic youths of the '60s, portraying the Baby Boomer generation in a narcissistic and negative light."
What was the turning point in the film's plot that led to a negative impact on its second half?,"The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).","The film starts off strong with a captivating performance by Charles S. Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor, driving the narrative forward and intertwining the stories of the white and black families effectively. However, the movie takes a nosedive when Dutton's character is abruptly killed off, leading to a disjointed, uninspiring, and overall dreadful second half. This drastic shift in focus and quality significantly drags down the viewing experience, resulting in a disappointing rating of 4 out of 10."
What elements of the movie made it feel like a concept catering to a specific generational audience?,"I like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .The main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .In 20 or 30 years Nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's . I can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .The soundtrack will feature bands like Nirvana , N.W.A , Public Enemy , Soundgarden etc .The movie like this will be just as cheesy as The 60's and I gurantee you NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .Next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project","The movie feels like a poorly executed attempt to cater to the baby boomer generation, with a lackluster plot and forced nostalgic elements. It comes across as insincere and fails to connect with viewers on a deeper level. The choice of actors cannot salvage the overall disappointment of the film's shallow concept."
What makes this movie so unappealing?,"Even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every Significant Moment of the 1960s (ok, so Katie didn't join the Manson Family, and nobody died at Altamont), this movie was still unbelievably awful. I got the impression that the ""writers"" just locked themselves in a room and watched ""Forrest Gump,"" ""The Wonder Years,"" and Oliver Stone's 60s films over and over again and called it research. A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode ""head spinning"". He was right.","Even if you could overlook the unrealistic portrayal of the characters in witnessing every major event of the 1960s, the movie is incredibly terrible. It seems like the writers simply copied ideas from other popular films and TV shows without bringing anything new to the table. The concluding scenes of the first episode were confusing, leaving viewers feeling disoriented."
What did the reviewer think about how the 60s were portrayed in the movie?,"Somehow they summed up the 60's, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivilized the major events and happenings and they ""claimed"" it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family. If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash. What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways, but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family. That poor son... Please NBC, do not make any movies about any other eras....leave that to PBS and the History Channel","The reviewer felt that the major events and happenings of the 60s were trivialized, with a lack of focus on the African-American family and an excessive emphasis on a single family's experiences. They also criticized the limited representation of the second family."
Do you think this film successfully explores any deeper themes or delivers meaningful insight?,"The only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in that light, it does deliver. <br /><br />If you're looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of ""issues"" with no insight whatsoever.<br /><br />Making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable, stereotypical ways. <br /><br />Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watchable, and Michael Rappaport turns in a good performance, but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite, it's hard to find anything redeeming.","The only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy.

What message does Higher Learning convey about race relations?,"Higher Learning says its OK for blacks to torment white people because they're all oppressors. most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages. Stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race. Incompetent acting, direction, and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick. An appalling piece of trash. the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed.

The acting, direction, and production values are all subpar, making it a painful movie to watch. This film is a disgrace and those responsible should feel ashamed."
Can you explain why the film was viewed as racially biased by some viewers?,"This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it. Ice Cube's character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other. When Omar Epps says "" I need to be with my people"", that racist remark spoke volume. And John, don't think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention. Nice touch!","Some viewers found the movie to be racially biased, portraying whites and non-black races as the antagonists within the educational setting. The characters were criticized for perpetuating stereotypes and failing to explore meaningful relationships between individuals of different races. The focus on racial divides was seen as a negative aspect of the film."
What elements contribute to making this movie feel like a misstep from a talented filmmaker like John Singleton?,"I know John Singleton's a smart guy 'coz he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct this? It's like the pilot of a bad ""going away to college for the first time"" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition, I guess. Who would've guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood? The angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of Neo-Nazis (and would be roomed-up with a black AND a Jew - just for laughs!) Even Laurence Fishburne's creepy reactionary history Professor just irritated me and I love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Big ups.","The movie seems to lean heavily on stereotypical characters and cliches, with gratuitous violence added in for commercial appeal. The storyline includes predictable scenarios like the date-rape victim switching food preferences and the angry loner being targeted by Neo-Nazis. The characters, including Laurence Fishburne's history professor, come across as irritating and lacking depth, with the exception of Busta Rhymes."
Do you think the movie has any redeeming qualities or moments that stand out?,"Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made some commercials in TV, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection). <br /><br />This little movie is like a Nacho's commercial: bad storyline, bad directing, and awful performances. I can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar...<br /><br />Nacho could made this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business men.","Despite Nacho Vigalondo's fame in Spain, this movie is cringeworthy with a weak storyline, subpar directing, and terrible performances. It's reminiscent of a commercial, not worthy of being shown in a prestigious venue like The Kodak Theater. It seems like the only reason this movie was made is due to the producer's connections in the Spanish TV industry."
What are some aspects of the movie that might make it entertaining for certain viewers?,"Hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting I'd suggest it. If thou you happen to like cheap b-movies like me it's good for a giggle! Other than that I wouldn't suggest that you rent it, I'd wait till it comes on the tube say round 4 am on the free access channel of your cable/satellite supplier. The band that did this sound track by the way was on the road after for about two years after this flick, and no they sounded just as bad live according to the two small town reviews I could find on them. So once again good if you find grass growing to much fun but good to watch if you like to see how NOT to shoot a low budget movie.","The reviewer feels that the movie is only worth watching if you have spare time and enjoy low-quality B-movies for a laugh. They suggest waiting to catch it on a free TV channel at 4 am due to its lackluster quality and amateurish production. Additionally, the soundtrack band, despite touring for two years, is said to sound just as bad live."
"What was your overall opinion of the film ""September 11""?","Now, I'm no film critic, but I truly hated ""September 11"". This film was, on a general basis, bad. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu's segment, which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter, the short films were at best boring, and at worst offensive. The worst in my mind was Youssef Chahine's pretentious segment in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause. The segment was completely off topic and, considering Chahine's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever, a waste of my time and patience. The idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice, it was tasteless.","The film ""September 11"" received mixed reviews, with most viewers finding it underwhelming and even offensive in some segments. While some praised Alejandro González Iñárritu's contribution, the majority found the rest of the short films to be boring and the comparisons made by Youssef Chahine to be pretentious and inappropriate. The concept of multiple directors sharing their perspectives on a tragedy was interesting in theory but fell short in execution according to many viewers."
What was the most disappointing aspect of the film?,"I too was intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this film, and was very disappointed. I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row, but it was not to be. I went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. There is not much of a plot, if any. I don't necessarily need that in a movie, but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in. The best I could say would be that it aspires to be an Altman-esque film, albeit with an extremely small ensemble. Sure, there are moments, but a few moments easily get thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this film. I give it a 3.<br /><br />","The most disappointing aspect of the film was the lack of a coherent plot or engaging storyline. Despite some brief moments that showed potential, the majority of the film felt slow and empty, ultimately failing to keep the audience entertained or invested in the story."
What is the general tone of the movie according to the review?,"If you have read the book - do not set your hopes high, if you have not - go read it, and never watch the film. It is strange to learn that Toby Young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script (as he claims himself in the post script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book.<br /><br />What the film seems to be aiming at - taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it - it achieves with perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms, and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had.<br /><br />You are better off not seeing it.","The movie fails to capture the essence and depth of the book, simplifying its content into cheap jokes and losing any meaningful message it could have conveyed."
What do you think about the League of Gentlemen?,"I like British humor, I believe it's one of the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (okay... maybe not Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but some of them I didn't understand.), but this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick. This show was good in some way; it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel I'm not hungry anymore. This is really just disgusting, sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting, watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car... I mean... what's so funny about that??? It makes me wanna puke. No humor, just disturbing images and cheap, toilet laughs... I don't know... if you like this stuff... you go ahead... watch it... but to be honest, people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems. Garbage.","The movie was utterly repulsive, lacking any humor, and filled with disturbing scenes that made me feel sick. It was a complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities. I would advise others to steer clear of this garbage film."
Is the humor in the movie comparable to Monty Python's style?,"Not funny - how can anyone link this to Monty Python? That is absolutely ridiculous - there are no laughs. This is not funny. Over the top, but ugly, weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately something that did not make them funny.<br /><br />It should be given some points for effort etc. whatever. Actually it appears there is a laugh track - or is there one? Hummm.... Since there are barely any laughs that's a debatable question.<br /><br />Maybe I'm doing it injustice - maybe it's some sort of exercise. Some sort of art - in that case anything goes, never mind.<br /><br />But these guys playing women with high-pitched voices, turned-up noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /><br />There is only one heir apparent to Monty Pythons intellectual wit and that is Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.","The humor in this movie falls flat, lacking the cleverness and wit associated with Monty Python. The attempt at over-the-top, weird humor comes across as forced and unamusing. The characters, particularly the men playing women with exaggerated features, fail to bring any genuine laughs, leaving the audience with a sense of confusion rather than amusement."
"What are some key elements that made ""Come Undone"" disappointing for you?","After reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say I was rather disappointed. The story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed. The characters, despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting. The sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be. I've never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn't explained well to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.","The story was hard to follow due to poorly executed flashbacks between the present and recent past, the characters felt flat and uninteresting despite the actors' efforts, the explicit sex and nudity seemed unnecessary to the plot, and the anti-climactic ending left many unanswered questions in a poorly explained storyline. Overall, a waste of time."
What did you think of the character development in the movie?,"There was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she's always wanted after the worst life possible, beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and this utterly destroys it in the end. It sounds weird, but I like the position Dean Cain was in at the end and the choice he made. He can't hurt her because he loves her and she's the mother of his child (I think the time frame makes it clear it's his child and not his brother's), but at the same he can't forgive her for all she's done, sleeping with his brother (which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way) and then being part of his death. In better hands this would have been a better movie, but for something I caught on late night cable, it's not bad.","There was potential in the storyline regarding the female lead's complex background and the struggle with trust. However, the execution fell short, particularly in how the relationship dynamics were portrayed. The film could have been more engaging with better direction and scriptwriting."
What were the standout elements of the movie according to the positive reviews?,"The plot was quite interesting, with the Russian revolution background. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was partly filmed there. Sadly, there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost icy. Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend. The ending, when we finally figure out who was actually after them, was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever. I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the 2 actors was slightly more credible.",The positive reviews highlight the interesting plot revolving around the Russian revolution background and the refreshing scenes filmed in Budapest.
What are some common elements found in the movie?,"Take young, pretty people, put them in an exotic locale, stick in a few bad guys, have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the flimsiest of plots, then work out a happy ending for everybody (other than the three or four who get murdered, of course) That's the classic (and successful) format of the Harlequin Romance. It's not very good but then it's not very bad either, like most of the little yellow pocket books. And the location stuff in Budapest is especially interesting, even if they didn't use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or show the city's famous thermal baths.","The movie follows a predictable and cliched formula of placing attractive young actors in a scenic location, adding some villains, and forcing a romantic connection between the two main characters. While the setting of Budapest adds some interest, the plot is thin and the movie fails to utilize some of the city's most iconic landmarks."
How does this film portray the LGBT community and what impact could it have if broadcasted widely?,"Geez, as a Gay man who lives in NYC I can gratefully say that I have never seen the underbelly of Gay Culture that is portrayed in this film - and I am glad of it!!! Was this film broadcast on TV across the United States there would be a great anti-Gay backlash and I cannot say that I would blame them. The people in this film do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American, what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare. The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-White) are blatant and unsettling - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film's ""cast"" - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation, but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one's self.","Despite portraying the underbelly of Gay Culture, this film has been criticized for its negative representation of the LGBT community. It has been condemned for including obviously underage characters, showcasing racist sentiments, and painting a bleak picture of drug use, unemployment, and lack of ambition among its characters. The film's depiction has been deemed as far from the reality of the average Gay or Transgender American, leading to concerns about a potential backlash if broadcasted on TV across the United States."
What are some issues with the movie's portrayal of police and storyline?,"It's a bad movie, it seems like there is only 5 police in HK, they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a Jacky Chan's movie. All the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only. When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In The movie, it's like all the good guys died without a reason.<br /><br />They story line of the movie also sucks, the story jump here and there and bored people. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think this is only a OK type of movie, I think U.S. made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one","The movie's depiction of the police force in Hong Kong was unrealistic and humorous, with officers rarely using their guns for anything other than pointing at suspects. The storyline was disjointed and failed to engage viewers, often feeling boring and hard to follow. Additionally, the movie's treatment of good guys dying without much justification was disappointing."
"What is the general plot of ""Meatball Machine""?","""Meatball Machine"" has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous, awful and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror films that I have ever came across. It is about good against evil and a coming-of-age tale, with the aim of to entertain with bloody, sleazy and humorous context. Because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm, but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely. The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst i have seen, if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie just have it all, it is bad to the bone!, A must see for every b-movie freak!!!... Simply: an enjoying and rare gem.","Terrible acting, gratuitous bloodletting, and nudity make ""Meatball Machine"" a cringe-worthy and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror film. The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are subpar, and the direction by Yudai Yamaguchi is lackluster. The violence lacks impact and the movie tries too hard to be shocking, resulting in a film that falls flat in entertainment value."
Did the film manage to keep the viewers engaged throughout its entirety?,"This film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core. The settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure. The lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis did in Hart's War. Tom, you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank! The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman. This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.","The film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core.

What makes this cinema-adaption not enjoyable according to the reviewer?,"Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it might be brilliant literature, this cinema-adaption really sucks as it's more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices. The story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight. I am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece, just perhaps that you can see Salma Hayek in here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that? No gracias.....","The reviewer found this cinema-adaptation to be a tedious and uninteresting watch, even though it is based on a book by Gabriel Marquez. The story was described as revolving around poverty and a cockfight, with little to keep the viewer engaged. The presence of Salma Hayek in the film was not enough to redeem its lack of entertainment value."
"What do you think about the predictable storyline and lack of chemistry between the leads in the movie ""The Life Adviser""?","If, in the first 10 minutes of this film, you don't realize that the main character, who writes a life advice column, is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself, then there is probably something wrong with you. The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isn't) <br /><br />There's almost no chemistry between the leads, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It's hard to believe Binoche's character would have any interest in him. Then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Isn't that great America!","The movie falls flat due to its unoriginal plot where the main character's transformation is evident from the start, and the lack of chemistry between the leads. Steve Carell's portrayal comes off as more creepy than comedic, making it hard to invest in the romance arc. The unrealistic and overly neat resolution further detracts from the overall viewing experience."
Can you elaborate on why some viewers found Dan in Real Life to be a terrible movie?,"The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.<br /><br />I have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.<br /><br />The dialog was so contrived, the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD film.","The reviewer expressed disappointment with Steve's portrayal, stating that the characters felt uncomfortable and the dialog was contrived. They criticized the film for being unoriginal, with a cookie-cutter family dynamic, and suggested that positive reviews on IMDb may not accurately reflect the movie's quality."
What aspect of the movie failed to impress the reviewer?,"seriously what the hell was this movie about,,simply stupid,,i'd give it 0 but,,,1""awful"" is the lowest you can go,,seriously this movie is not worth watching,,waste of time, i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10,,i seriously can make a better movie than this , hire some other unemployed people,,'n i promise i'll make a movie better than this,,this movie was so bad,,that i'll never watch a movie starring Steve Carrel again,bottom line don't waste your time to download it off the net or rent it,,i'd nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is Something Gotta give but after that this is the second","The movie is described as simply stupid, a waste of time, and not worth watching. The reviewer believes they can make a better movie than this and recommends not wasting time downloading or renting it."
What are some unbelievable aspects of the movie?,"I couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie. Do families like this really exist somewhere? There have been many comments describing this family as akin to LLBean models and such, and I think that that is a great description of how they behaved.<br /><br />More absurdly unbelievable writing/acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in High School as ""pigface"" who, of course, has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world-not for the money,) and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I quit watching...<br /><br />If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental, self-indulgent waste of time.","The portrayal of the family as perfect and the unrealistic character development, such as a former high school outcast becoming a Harvard-educated plastic surgeon and bedding the lead actor on the first date, made it difficult to sit through the movie."
Were the characters poorly developed in this movie?,"What was this supposed to be? A remake of Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What a slow, dreary, boring, who-gives-a-damn-about-these-people movie!!! Just simply painful to sit through, I turned it off before it was over. It's so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; like I said: can you say ""Fisher King""? And how does this psychotic character function in his daily life? We aren't supposed to think that deeply, I guess. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to turn violent on him? If they were such good friends, how did they grow apart? If Cheadle is so in control, why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street? We are never told. That's why Fisher King was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks. Nearly 8 out of 10 average score? I don't agree. At all. Even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating, and this crap doesn't deserve to be in the same universe with them.","The characters in this film were poorly developed, making it difficult for the audience to care about them or connect with their struggles. The pacing was slow and the storyline was uninteresting, resulting in a tedious and unengaging viewing experience. The lack of depth in the relationships between the characters further added to the overall disappointment of the movie."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find disappointing despite the presence of nudity?,"Ursula Andress' naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) have great bodies as well. Then why is the higher grade that I can give to a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because, to get to Ursula's unbelievable body, we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring (keep in mind that I watched the full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American one which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous material). In typical Italian-comedy tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (the army freak, the ""latin lover"", the constant drunk, the naive maid) that are not funny, simply overacted. Final word: watch this, but keep your finger on the fast-forward button, you're gonna need it. (*)","Despite the appealing nudity in the film, the reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with the overall quality, describing it as unfunny, boring, and filled with exaggerated and overacted characters."
"What are some weaknesses in the film ""The Perfect Son""?","The past creeps up on a rehab-addict when he reconnects with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last stint in detox. ""Life's dramas"", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even the writing has any bite or wit). The cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another, and the music and photography are lugubrious (a couple of the visual effects are laughable, indie-cliché touches that reek of a puny budget). Although written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure but I think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men, estranged brothers growing closer, never quite gels, never feels natural or seems lived in. It's an attempt to get inside a male relationship, but the careful, sterile presentation is a cheat. No one's heart is in this, living, breathing, or bleeding this material. ""The Perfect Son"" is quickly diffused by too many cooks in the kitchen.","The film lacks genuine emotional depth and fails to fully capture the essence of the male relationships it tries to depict. The simplistic presentation, unremarkable writing, and unconvincing acting by its attractive cast make it difficult for the audience to emotionally connect with the characters. The visual effects are subpar and some scenes come off as cliché due to the limited budget. The collaboration between the male director and female producer seems to have hindered the authenticity of the male-centric narrative, resulting in a film that feels forced and lacking in genuine sentiment. The overall lack of passion and commitment from the creators ultimately leaves ""The Perfect Son"" feeling hollow and unconvincing."
What makes the film disappointing despite its premise?,"The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price. I expected a ""Based on the true story"" movie only to find a shot on home video hodge-podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non-related slaughter house scenes. The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects. I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but, low and behold it only got worse. If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.","The movie disappoints with its poorly shot clips, pathetic acting, and non-related slaughter house scenes, making it not worth the purchase price. The numerous rewind situations seemed to only prolong the feature rather than enhance it, and the overall experience was so bad that the viewer wished for a better ending that never came."
What makes this movie lack authenticity and fail to accurately portray the BTK killer's story?,"To compare this squalor with an old, low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old, low budget porno flick. The animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case says in part, ""gripping retelling of the BTK Killer's reign of terror."" This is NOT a retelling. A retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why. None of these things are true. I'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly, this IS NOT one of them. This isn't even about the BTK killer. Save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent Dahmer instead. THAT serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you just HAVE to see this movie for yourself, check it out for free at your local library and even then, you'll still feel cheated.","The film fails to deliver an authentic retelling of the BTK killer's crimes, with meaningless animal scenes and inaccurate representation. It is suggested to watch a different film like Dahmer for a more accurate portrayal."
What are some reasons why you would advise against watching this movie?,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie. Its like a low budget made for TV Canadian movie. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many others out there. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR. :~( . Is it possible to write ten lines? The acting was horrific. It had absolutely no flow. I saw the made for TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much better(in comparison to this one). I am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they missed by a mile. It appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights.","The movie is described as low budget and poorly made, with terrible acting and no coherent storyline. The reviewer is particularly disappointed in the comparison to another made-for-TV movie about the BTK killer, suggesting this film missed the mark entirely."
Can you believe how terrible this movie was?,"I can't really say what I think about this movie, its against the guidelines, I've watched many many films, and this has got to be the worst one yet, Extremely low budget, I'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes, cause I could of did a better job with a b&w 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys. It was so bad I registered just to leave a comment, cause I had to tell someone, movie rental place wasn't enough. But this is my 2 cents worth, I suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself. Cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again. Now i leave you with this comment. I hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money .. =)","The movie was extremely low budget and poorly made, with the supposed highlight being the slaughterhouse scenes. It was so bad that the reviewer felt compelled to register just to leave a negative comment, warning others not to waste their money on it."
"Can you provide a negative review of a movie, based on positive reviews?","This movie is just so awful. So bad that I can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible.<br /><br />None of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly. Lots of slaughterhouse footage. Weird cuts and edits. No continuity to the plot. The acting is absolutely the most amateur I have ever seen.<br /><br />This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content. The camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky. It looks as if it was shot on video.<br /><br />In fact, now that they've got Dennis Rader with life in prison, I wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well.<br /><br />Seriously, don't even think about watching this one. I'd give it a negative star if I could.","This movie is an absolute disaster. The re-enactment of the crimes is completely inaccurate, with disturbing slaughterhouse footage thrown in. The editing is choppy, the plot makes no sense, and the acting is painfully amateur. It's clear this film was rushed for profit, as the camera work is shaky and out of focus. Watching this movie feels like a crime itself - avoid it at all costs."
What specific aspects of the movie made it hard to watch and not worth the money?,"This movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what, Being from and growing up in Wichita Kansas;I know for a fact 90% of the movie was Bogus. Aside from the names of some of the victims, nothing else much was correct. The movie looks like it was made with dad's handy-cam, It had footage that I believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house. I usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it, but due to the bad acting, poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short ending.It was a struggle to watch it through to the ending. I recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry. Crunch","The movie was a disappointment for someone familiar with the real events, as most of it was inaccurately portrayed. The overall quality of the movie was subpar, with shoddy camerawork, bad acting, and lackluster sets. Additionally, the ending was underwhelming and failed to redeem the film's shortcomings."
What could have been a major drawback in the movie?,"This movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the DVD from the movie store. This movie made me sick not because it was gory, but because i wasted 2 50 on it!!!! It looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited slaughterhouse footage into it! I am so ticked off, even The BTK Killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG I cant even get all the words out to explain it DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!",The movie was so poorly made that it looked like a low-budget production done by amateurs. The special effects were so unconvincing that it was hard to take the film seriously. Not worth the money or time.
Can you describe your experience watching this movie?,"I have never watched a movie in so little time. The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit. It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film. There was obviously no money for lighting, filming, sets, location, scriptwriters, editors, actors... Oh, there was absolutely no story either! I need to write ten lines of comment... Bad, awful, horrible, wretched, anguishing, tortuous, bilious, nauseous, sickening, fromage, disgusting, flimsy, icky, yucky, pukey, stinky, smelly, vile, putrid, all-thumbs-down, and I don't know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was!","The movie was an absolute disaster! It felt like a low-budget production with poor lighting, filming, and sets. The storyline was nonexistent, and the acting was terrible. It was a struggle to even sit through it, and I had to rely on the fast forward function to speed things up. Overall, a complete waste of time and money."
Can you tell me more about your thoughts on the accuracy of the movie?,This was the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of I'm from Kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all. Its like they took BTK name and made up the rest. On top of that it looks like someone was like I've only got $20 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don't worry about researching btk at all just make up something. seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie. The slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter BTK did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie. The made for TV ones are way better and way more accurate,This was the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies.

What did the reviewer find disappointing about the movie?,"Don't see this movie. Bad acting and stupid gore effects. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks,instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you, the watcher. Disgusting. The murders are pretty lame, basically strangulation. One woman he stuffs worms in her mouth, one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = BTK broiler, burger king's ""killer"" new sandwich....ha ha. I don't think this movie relied too much on actual facts. I mean, he real BTK killer didn't carry around a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms..and oh yeah...a slaughtered cow head too. Go figure.","The reviewer found the acting to be bad and criticized the gore effects as stupid. They mentioned that the murders in the movie were not cool and the shock factor was derived from using animal slaughter videos, which they found disgusting. The killings were described as lame, including scenes where worms were stuffed into a woman's mouth and raw hamburgers were placed on someone's face. The reviewer expressed skepticism about the accuracy of the facts portrayed in the film, pointing out unrealistic elements such as the inclusion of rodents, scorpions, and a slaughtered cow head carried by the killer, which they found far-fetched."
Is the movie trying to portray animal rights activists in a negative light or exploiting a real-life tragedy for their own gain?,"I question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the BTK killer's motives. Are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Don't they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough? What a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personality experiment: What disturbs you more, the slaughterhouse or the human murders? They used actual names of some of the victims....this movie was hideous, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to awaken and redraw the line!","The movie was critiqued for its questionable motive in portraying animal rights activists negatively and exploiting real-life tragedies, such as the BTK killer case, for their own agenda. It was deemed disrespectful and insulting to the victims, with viewers feeling that the film crossed a moral line and lacked sensitivity towards those affected."
What is your evaluation of the movie?,"This movie features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty. She has stunning green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers.<br /><br />The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report, or remotely well done. There is no skill apparent in it's production. It is like a bad student film. The story's horrific elements do not make you sick, it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.","The movie features a stunning actress named Danielle Petty, with beautiful green eyes, in a few initial scenes and the final scene. However, she's the only redeeming aspect of this film. The overall movie is repulsive and lacks any commendable elements. It fails as a horror film or a fake documentary, lacking in production quality and skill. The horrific elements do not evoke fear; instead, it's the poor execution that leaves a sickening feeling. This movie is akin to a low-quality student project and deserves a rating of zero stars."
Can you elaborate on why this movie is considered the worst horror/thriller you've seen in 29 years?,"This is by far the worst horror/thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO. This movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it. The plot isn't even the worst part of this movie.....its the acting, camera work, lighting, and sound. there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. whoever paid to have this film made is broke now. I hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie. In its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual BTK killer's capture but I've seen movie of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to this.","This movie is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The acting is appalling, the camera work is amateurish, the lighting is atrocious, and the sound quality is subpar. It's a shameless attempt to exploit a true crime story, and it fails miserably in every aspect. Watching this movie will make you feel like you've lost brain cells."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find particularly terrible?,"I rented this horrible movie. The worst think I have ever seen. I believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job. The worse film I have ever seen and I have seen some bad ones. Nothing scary except I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much. The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash. The slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a B movied look like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick. I would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again","The reviewer found the acting, characters, and slaughterhouse scenes to be horrible and low budget, making the film a piece of trash that is not worth even the minimal rental price."
What was so disappointing about the movie that left the reviewer regretting their time spent watching it?,"Oh My God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, Do Not Watch This Movie! It it 82 minutes of my life I will never get back. Sure, I could have stopped watching half way through. But I thought it might get better. It Didn't. Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual. No wonder us Australians/New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible, from the acting to the editing. I don't even normally write reviews on here, but in this case I'll make an exception. I only wish someone had of warned me before I hired this catastrophe","The movie was an absolute disaster, a complete waste of time. The storyline was weak, the acting was terrible, and there was nothing redeeming about it at all. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. Just avoid it at all costs."
What was the biggest drawback of the movie?,"This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth. Why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce. Don't even waste your time watching this for free. Low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of, which is really what this movie did. If they would allow me to give a -10 to this movie I would. The acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save your time and money by not watching this movie.","The biggest drawback of this movie is the disrespect it showed towards the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in the movie were far from the truth, making it a made-up farce that does not do justice to the real events. The low budget production, terrible acting, and outdated visuals made this movie a complete waste of time and money."
What was your overall opinion on the movie's portrayal of Dennis L.Rader?,"I was lying on my bed, with a really bad cold or flu or whatever. I figure maybe I'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago. I wish I never picked this movie! After I watched it I felt even more sick and I wanted to throw up. Afterwords(when I got better of course) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one. I hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way I felt after I first watched it. I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least that movie had better reviews on this site.",
What are some notable aspects of the film?,"This film is so bad it simply defies reality. The filming is grade school material at best, the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form. So bad it can't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of Showgirls. The ONLY thing this DVD had going for it was the cover art. <br /><br />All I can write to those of you who haven't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage. If you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash.","The film is so bad that it's hard to believe it's real. The filming looks like it was done by kids, the acting is terrible, and the director should never make another movie again. It's not even so bad it's good like Showgirls. The only good thing about this movie is the cover. You'd be doing yourself a favor by avoiding this garbage."
What did you think about the overall quality of the movie?,"I was glad to watch this movie free of charge as I am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library. Nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has horrible acting and directing. How can a movie as this one ever be made. The director should be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors, it is for sure not a jumping board into a career. Please make sure that you'll not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and directing awful. There are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the ""LOW 10"". Another example would be ""Dracula 3000"". People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason. <br /><br />In this case I would watch it even another 10 (or at least one more time).",
Did the movie fail to deliver a cohesive storyline?,"I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better. The acting, the music drowning out the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie all the way through b\c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines. I never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered. What did that have to do with the ""real"" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors\actresses in this movie. The script would have turned me away within the first page of reading. You would be better off watching paint dry.","The movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. The confusion began right at the beginning, with disjointed scenes and lack of explanation. The plot seemed to jump around aimlessly, leaving viewers scratching their heads. It was impossible to follow along with the story, which made it a frustrating and unsatisfying watch. The lack of a cohesive storyline left a gaping hole in the overall viewing experience."
What are the main reasons people should avoid watching this movie?,This movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero! if you have a weak tummy AT ALL don't watch. animal rights people you don't want to watch either. it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen! the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story. its really really super creepy that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people! still feel safe when you punch in that little code? i don't! He had access to every code in Kansas!!!!!! I hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring! Do your self a favor and don;t rent/buy this movie i think it cost about $20 to make that INCLUDES their OVER paid actors!!!!,"This movie received a one-star rating mainly due to its extremely disturbing content that may be upsetting for viewers with sensitive stomachs or strong animal rights beliefs. The movie has the potential to influence people towards becoming vegetarians. The story being based on true events adds an element of eeriness, especially considering the killer's previous employment at a security company with access to private codes. Overall, the reviewer found the movie more mentally disturbing than genuinely scary, and did not recommend spending money on it."
Can you provide a negative review of the movie?,"It's made in 2007 and the CG is bad for a movie made in 1998. At one part in the movie there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good, but this just makes the extremely amateur work on the CG stuff look even worse.<br /><br />The writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible. This is as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC... pure crap! Again, as with the other movies, the only scary part about this movie is that it actually got made and is now being aired on the sci-fi channel.<br /><br />I still can't understand how they somehow get people who do have some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow get them to act as terrible as everyone else in the movie.<br /><br />For those of you who are unsure, the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in his review... or he is one of the people who worked on this movie.","The movie's CG effects are outdated, making it look worse than movies from 1998. The writing, acting, and directing are all terrible, making it on par with some of the worst movies in the genre. It's surprising that actors with some skill could deliver such poor performances, and the only scary thing about the movie is that it actually got made and aired on TV."
What makes this movie one of the worst of all time?,"This has to be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were horrendous, the acting was b-movie and the effects were just plain Nintendo 64 qualified. You would think that they would put a little more effort into it. Of course, it is a Scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate, but this one takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, as a shake-your-head in disbelief movie, this one does well. <br /><br />Although it appears to have some 'known' actors and actresses in this, it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort. <br /><br />The graphics might have been good in the '60's or even early '70's but come on, this is 2009! I wont give spoilers out, let's just say that if you have played ""Jurassic Park"" on the Nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film<br /><br />It is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing","The graphics were horrendous, the acting was b-movie quality, and the effects were reminiscent of Nintendo 64. The overall lack of effort and outdated presentation left the viewer laughing in disbelief, making it clear that the movie falls far below expectations for a SciFi channel production. The presence of familiar actors did not salvage the subpar quality, leaving viewers wondering why they wasted their time sitting through it."
What is the star-studded cast of this movie like?,"Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mob boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very gorgeous), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and a make such a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation in the cast. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil):' Prazer em Matar-te!' ('Pleasure in Killing You!')<br /><br />","The movie features a star-studded cast including Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane, Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, and Billy Idol. Despite such immense talent, the film falls flat as a comedy and fails to deliver any humor, making it a disappointing waste of time. The reviewer rates it a low four out of ten."
"What are some of the issues with the casting choices and overall presentation of ""The Barbarian and the Geisha"" according to this review?","There are often badly-matched couples (in the general sense of the term) -in Huston's movies :""African Queen"" ""Heaven knows Mister Allison"" ""roots of Heaven"" ""Misfits"" ...""The Barbarian and the geisha"" (check the title) is another good example,so to speak.It seems that Japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as ""Sayonara"" "" the world of Suzie Wong"" and ""the teahouse of the August moon"" bear witness. Huston's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot(with the exception of ""Susie "" maybe).John Wayne perfectly fits in Ford's world ,in Huston's he's like a bull in a china shop.His Japanese partner is totally bland.Even the dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute boredom.<br /><br />Only those utterly enamoured of Huston's every work need to choose this ,among all his other great movies around.","The review criticizes the badly-matched couples, particularly John Wayne's role, describing him as out of place in the film. The Japanese partner is labeled as bland, and even dramatic scenes fail to save the movie from being painfully boring. Only die-hard Huston fans are advised to watch this film."
What are some problematic aspects of the film?,"If I had realized John Wayne was in this movie, I would not have watched it. It's demeaning to the Japanese, unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person. But then, most John Wayne movies are like that. Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. The movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of Japan. Maybe it's Hollywood that should be isolated.To put it as succinctly as possible, this film is appalling jingoistic claptrap.(Sort of a Madama Butterfly with bad music.)","The film has been criticized for being demeaning to the Japanese people, perpetuating jingoistic stereotypes, and showcasing outdated Hollywood beliefs. It has also been described as embarrassing and lacking in cultural sensitivity."
What are some flaws mentioned in the movie review?,"A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there's nothing much to distinguish it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. No one in the cast comes off too well; with this lame script that's not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, won't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I don't think.","The movie ""Chasers"" is compared to 'The Last Detail' and is criticized for having a lackluster plot and unimpressive characters. The reviewer finds the script to be weak and no actor in the cast stands out. Dennis Hopper, the director, is predicted to not think highly of this movie if he ever reflects on it in the future."
What role does William McNamara play in the movie and what stands out about his performance?,"... so I thought I'd throw in a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- it's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less. There's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies. There's a nice bit where he has to chase after Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. William McNamara is naturally a little on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of a booty. Also, there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada. If you're inclined to do so, and come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a ""road trip"" are. I'd just like thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. Can William McNamara act? Heck if I know.","The movie seems to heavily rely on gratuitous nudity and objectifying the actor William McNamara, which takes away from any potential substance or actual acting skills in the film."
Can you provide a summary of the movie's plot?,"This movie down-shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd, grinding gears all the way to the sappy, b-movie finish-line. The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie. That is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast, you may miss it. Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad-to-mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints - especially the unbelievable character, Al. I wonder if he's got a job for me in Cincinnati?",
What makes Living Legend episodes stand out compared to the Fire In Space episode in Mission: Galactica?,"Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.","The network's handling of Mission: Galactica resulted in a forced combination of two original episodes, leading to a lackluster and disappointing viewing experience. The rushed production and network interference impacted the overall quality of the show."
Can you believe how surprisingly entertaining and enjoyable this movie is despite being considered one of the worst of all time?,"The Derek's have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title ""worst movie of all time"", and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes. In fact, this film can be regarded as belonging to the ""so bad, it's good"" category, right up there with the products of the likes of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman. This explains the IMDb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top marks.<br /><br />Anthony Quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time, but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad, it has to be seen to be believed.",The Derek's have managed to create a cult classic with their hilariously bad movie featuring Anthony Quinn's unbelievably terrible performance as a randy ghost.
"What was one common mention regarding the movie ""Ghosts Can't Do It""?","The Dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for Bo after ""10"".<br /><br />I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day, the script for ""Ghosts Can't Do It"" was circulating among the trainers in the ""fish house"" where food was prepared for the dolphins. There was one scene where a -dolphin- supposedly propositions Bo (or Bo the dolphin), asking to ""go make eggs."" Reading the script, we -lauuughed-...<br /><br />We did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility, although our dolphins -were- in ""The Big Blue!""<br /><br />This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he had fun in this film, as it certainly didn't do anything for his legacy.","The Dereks seemed to have trouble finding appropriate roles for Bo, with a particularly criticized scene involving a dolphin making questionable advances towards the main character. Some viewers found the script to be quite absurd and felt that it did not contribute positively to Anthony Quinn's career legacy."
"What can viewers expect from ""Ghosts Can't Do It""?","With a Bo Derek movie, the audience get just what they expect. A paper thin plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek in no clothes. 'Ghosts can't do it' is just that. The first fifteen minutes is ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles, but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see nude women or bad acting, rent any porno movie.","""Ghosts Can't Do It"" disappoints with a shallow plot and excessive focus on Bo Derek's nudity. Despite Anthony Quinn's solid acting, the film ultimately feels like a waste of time, catering more to gratuitous scenes rather than substance. If you're looking for quality performances, look elsewhere like in Quinn's acclaimed works."
What are the major flaws in the movie?,"The worst, and chock full of people who really ought to know better, (the cast have six Oscars between them). It's set in 'contemporary' Africa, (it was made in 1979), and is about the slave trade. It's appallingly scripted and acted, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden reach a career low in this one), and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus. It's also ludicrously plotted. You don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone. This is as bad as it gets.","The movie is an absolute disaster, featuring an unconvincing storyline set in Africa during the slave trade era. The cast, including esteemed actors with multiple Oscars, deliver a performance that can only be described as cringe-worthy. The film lacks any semblance of excitement or moral depth, and the plot is utterly absurd. It's clear that the director, Richard Fleischer, failed to deliver any semblance of coherence or authenticity to the movie."
Why does the movie seem to target Arabs and Germans specifically for criticism?,"The story at the outset is interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century from west Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies: Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that very Arab-looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch Blacks in West Africa is as believable as Whites hunting for slaves in ""Roots"". Obviously both trades are/were run by locals and involve(d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's child and sex slave trade, Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International. So why only point out Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a Jewish director.<br /><br />The acting is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.","The film's attempt to highlight the issue of modern-day slavery in an intriguing setting falls short due to its apparent bias against Arabs and Germans. The portrayal of these groups as the primary culprits lacks nuance and fails to address the broader global issue of human trafficking. The director's focus on these particular ethnicities comes across as one-sided and fueled by personal prejudices, detracting from the overall message of the movie."
What aspects of the film make it appealing to fans of 80's movies and classic Porsches?,"I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is bland as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.<br /><br />All in all, please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to watch crappy movies.",
Can you explain why Angelina Jolie being in the movie was disappointing according to your review?,"OMG this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot I'm a Film student. I don't understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money that badly? I love AJ and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this 2 tick another one off. It was SOO bad! not even good bad, just bad bad. It had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes. I cant even say AJ looked good in it because well she didn't. The plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re-telling of Romeo and Juliet then its not. All round disappointing. Maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise I really don't recommend it.","The movie was a huge letdown, despite having a few comedic moments, it fell flat in terms of plot and overall quality. The predictability of the storyline made it uninteresting, and even the presence of Angelina Jolie couldn't salvage the film."
Can you talk about the overall atmosphere in the movie?,"I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second ""Night of The Demons;"" and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as Robert Englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this film !","The movie has a compelling and intense atmosphere throughout that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The suspenseful music and dark lighting add to the overall creepy vibe, making it a thrilling experience from start to finish."
What makes this movie stand out despite initially seeming bad?,"This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad. And indeed, we couldn't take most of it. There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). CRIPES. I've never watched a single scene from a film so many times (I'm estimating forty or so). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing for showing off his loins. I last saw the film a couple months ago, but I can't stop laughing as I type. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You've got to see it for yourself.","Despite its initial unimpressive appearance, this movie surprisingly contains a scene that is hilariously unforgettable, involving Robert Englund in a memorable and outrageous seduction scene."
Does the movie offer anything unique or compelling to keep the audience engaged?,"I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time, or my friend's. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that old people have a past before they got old (no kidding). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.","The movie failed to captivate me due to its bland characters and uninteresting story. I found the narrative to be dull and uninspiring, making it a struggle to stay engaged throughout. Despite the efforts of the actors, the weak storyline overshadowed any potential they had to salvage the film. Overall, I regret wasting my time and recommend avoiding this lackluster production."
What changes were made in the newer version of the movie?,"Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...","The newer version of this movie completely misses the mark compared to the original. It lacks depth and purpose, feeling like a lazy attempt to modernize a classic. The alterations in characters' backgrounds seem forced and unnecessary. Overall, this film fails to capture the essence and impact of the original, leaving viewers disappointed and frustrated."
What kind of movie is being criticized in the positive reviews?,"Movies like these are to the originals what Album Oriented Rock stations are to what music used to be like - repetitive, boring, and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones. I AM glad that Aragorn wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this P.O.S. Go back and watch the 1971 version, count the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version, and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone else's ideas, and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day.","The movie is being criticized for being repetitive, boring, and lacking original energy due to corporate interference. The reviewer expressed disappointment in the lack of creativity and originality compared to the original version."
"How did the remake of ""Vanishing Point"" compare to the original?","This movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original, i suppose. Which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'Vanishing Point' the original, is so ironic. I'm sure it wasn't intended that way, but the original was filmed in 1970, and released in 1971. The REAL 'VANISHING POINT' was the end of an era, which pretty much ended in the early 1970s. <br /><br />In this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more PC in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably. ""Sanitized for your Protection"" <br /><br />Inserting the American Indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of a 'noble purpose' to the trip was subtraction by addition. I'm glad I watched it however, it made me appreciate the original that much more. The original is a cult classic and golden. This remake is dreadful.","The remake of ""Vanishing Point"" fell short of capturing the essence of the original film, as it stripped away its counter-cultural elements and attempted to appeal to a broader audience by being more politically correct. The addition of American Indian scenes felt unnecessary and the film's attempt to inject a 'noble purpose' to the trip was considered a misstep. Overall, this remake was deemed a disappointment compared to the cult classic and golden original."
What makes the hero in the movie stand out and why does he become a folk hero?,"Pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? They were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive.<br /><br />This film has absolutely no substance. The Viggo Mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero. Why? He speeds along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking. No one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone. Even worse, when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red-neck terrorist, no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends.<br /><br />Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero.<br /><br />The ending is absolutely unbelievable.",The film lacks substance as the Viggo Mortensen character is portrayed as a hero without much depth or explanation for his actions. The storyline is weak and the ending is not believable.
"What makes ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" stand out as a movie?","All right I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquers the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch was going to do next. Would Merlin help Santa Claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever seen and I love it for that. :D","The movie captures audiences' attention with its bizarre and ridiculous storyline, keeping viewers on edge and intrigued to see how the characters like Santa Claus and Mr. Pitch will unfold. Even though it may be considered a terrible movie, its unique charm and entertainment value make it worth watching."
What makes this movie an entertaining watch according to this review?,"The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people. (as MST3k Commentary states it...""Sanata has the dirt on every! Santa's Tentacles reach far and wide! There is no hiding from the Klaus Organization"")<br /><br />From telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything. Its amazing that the CIA doesn't have Santa on the payroll. <br /><br />Satan's dance routine is hilarious. Pitch...he is so useless.<br /><br />The cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous. Very low budget but so fun to watch. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version for even more laughs.<br /><br />You even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids.<br /><br />I give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.","The movie is praised for its low-budget charm, hilarious dance routine by Santa, and the enjoyment derived from watching it with Mystery Science Theatre 3000 commentary. However, it is criticized for its poor production quality."
What makes this movie stand out as a horrifying experience?,"Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anybody? This steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point; it makes ""The Violent Years"" look like ""Casablanca""! ""Santa Claus"" also makes Keith Richards' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission. I've had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating bullets, that will never come close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being. However, I can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well. Also, if you're looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Don't check out this movie, as I've been notified the MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan, here's ""Santa Claus"".",This movie is described as a complete disaster that can give you nightmares and is compared to a nightmare version of Santa Claus. The reviewer suggests not to watch the movie and mentions that a better alternative is the MST3K version.
What makes the portrayal of Santa Claus in this movie particularly unsettling?,"This is perhaps the creepiest display of Santa Claus ever committed to any medium, whether it be a book, a picture, or a movie. Santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing Merlin in to help him defeat one of Satan's minions, Pitch, doesn't make things any better. It's laughable to say the least, with bad effects, even for 1959 standards. If a kid were to watch this movie, he'd have nightmares and never want Santa to visit. They'd be scarred for life. Imagine the kid's in ""A Christmas Story"" when they start screaming after being put on Santa's lap. That's how this would turn out if kid's see this movie.","The film's depiction of Santa Claus is described as creepy and unsettling, with Santa looking like a perv and the storyline involving him enlisting Merlin to defeat one of Satan's minions does not help improve the situation. The effects in the film are also criticized as being poor, even by 1959 standards. If a child were to watch this movie, it is suggested that they would likely have nightmares and be scared of Santa for life, drawing comparisons to the children's screaming reaction in ""A Christmas Story"" when they are placed on Santa's lap."
Did the dark and creepy scenes in the movie overshadow the comedic and entertaining aspects of it?,"I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $5 on VHS. She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This movie, however, scared the hell out of me. You may be asking yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day, for if Santa doesn't make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just downright creepy.",
What makes the setting of this movie unique and why did the reviewer still find it enjoyable?,"This is kind of a weird movie, given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against Satan and his minions...but it's still kinda fun.<br /><br />It has some genuine laughs...whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable, though. This movie is not good, but I can say I really enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie over ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", ""Santa Claus"" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or ""The Santa Clause"" with Tim Allen.","The movie was strange with its depiction of Santa Claus living on a cloud in space and battling Satan, but it managed to provide some genuine laughs, though it's debatable if they were all intentional. While the film isn't particularly good, the reviewer still found enjoying in watching it and would suggest it over some other Santa-themed movies."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find unsettling and creepy?,"This movie is supposed to be a ""lighthearted"" tale about Santa Claus and his ""magical and mystical"" wonders. But instead it comes off as being downright creepy. Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1) the way Santa looks.- Have you ever seen a more horrible looking Santa Claus? and 2) the ""evil rep. of Satan"" Pitch's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch. Only watch this movie if it happens to be the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh. I can't believe this is a children's movie.","The reviewer felt that the portrayal of Santa Claus and the character Pitch's bizarre dances were horrifying and sickening, making the movie unsuitable for children and more of a source for laughs when watched through the Mystery Science Theater 3000 lens."
What kind of reactions did the reviewer and their spouse have while watching the movie?,"I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film, but one word could suffice: bizarre. Hubby and I didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie. We kept looking at each other with our best ""What the...?"" expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this movie. Killer tomatoes were funny, but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird, weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, don't let him/her see this movie. Preteens can watch it -- probably with ""What the...?"" expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others, you might want to spike their eggnog.<br /><br />Quite possibly the worst film ever made.","The reviewer and their spouse found the movie to be truly dreadful, bizarre, and possibly the worst film ever made. They didn't find it funny, but rather sick and filled with disturbing imagery. The inclusion of innocent children in the film raised concerns for them, and they questioned the sanity of the mind behind such a production."
What are some common criticisms of the movie?,"With title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk. Acting bad. Script bad. Director bad. Grammar bad.<br /><br />Movie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell. Movie make bad racial stereotype. Why come every movie with black hero have drug addict? Why come hero always have to dance to be success? Why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie? Why come letter ""s"" can't be in title?<br /><br />Hollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper English.<br /><br />Do self favor and not go see.","The movie was slammed for its poor acting, bad script, amateur directing, and utilizing negative racial stereotypes. The excessive noise and yelling in the film was off-putting, and the reliance on clichés like the drug-addicted black hero and the dancing rapper were heavily criticized. The overall lack of intelligence in the movie and its failure to use proper English added to the disappointing experience. It's recommended to avoid watching this film."
"Based on the positive reviews, can you generate a prompt and a negative review for this movie?","I can always tell when something is going to be a hit. I see it or hear it, and get a good feeling. I did not get a good feeling watching the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this film, and I am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. I was in fact proved right.<br /><br />The first thing that threw me off was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics(I am black by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title, and for this time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar. I heard the dialog, saw the acting and all I could do was make faces.<br /><br />I also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone. At least ""You Got Served"" was better than this in my opinion. Even the soundtrack didn't thrill me.","The movie seemed to lack originality and the title is criticized for using what some perceive as poor grammar. The overall theme of dance movies is deemed to be overdone, with the acting and dialogue received negatively by viewers. The soundtrack also failed to impress, leading to disappointment among viewers who were expecting more."
"What was one redeeming quality of the movie ""How She Moves""?","""How She Moves"" springs to life only when its high-energy, talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera. Otherwise, this stale strive-suffer-and-succeed story is low on energy, low on originality, and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other, likeminded films that have come before it.<br /><br />Rutina Wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner-city youngster who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step-dance competitions, but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and undistinguished direction. As noted earlier, the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing, but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting.","The movie ""How She Moves"" lacked energy, originality, and failed to stand out from other similar films. The story was predictable and uninspired, resulting in poor execution that did not do justice to the talented cast."
What makes this dance movie stand out from others in its genre?,"Its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I do not see where all this 'its not that bad' rubbish is coming from. The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing' movies out there. Its terrible! The name should scream don't watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones don't even deserve a watch. I give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 not to watch this, and not to waste your money. The 1.6/10 should tell it all. This movie should not have even be made.","While many viewers may find ""How she move"" to be just another stereotypical MTV generation dance movie with terrible acting and an unoriginal storyline, it fails to deliver on the dance scenes that could potentially redeem it. With a rating of just 1.6/10, this movie is a prime example of what happens when a lackluster script meets uninspired performances. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid wasting your time and money on this film."
What stands out as a positive aspect in this film?,"This movie was absolutely ghastly! I cannot fathom how this movie made it to production. Nothing against the cast of the movie, of course, this is all the fault of the writing team. You take the old average plot - let's dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or STEP in this case. But this one lacks any semblance of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about. With Canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American setting - this film falls very flat. On a positive note, the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well. Looks like the production budget was very generous as well. My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film. Net result - How she move is How she sucks.","The directing was pretty good, and the cinematography was decent, giving an impression of a generous production budget. However, the writing of the movie was lacking, with an uninteresting and average plot that failed to engage the audience. The inclusion of Canadian actors in an American setting also contributed to the film feeling flat and disconnected. Overall, ""How She Move"" fails to deliver a compelling story or characters for viewers to care about."
What are some specific reasons why this movie failed to captivate the audience?,"This movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should. Among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes. The movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy. The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college, and the dialogue is the worse I have seen in a movie. The plot also was worse by ten fold. I'd stick to the amateur route. The audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too. Unless your a diehard Jenna Jameson fan there is little here. 4/10","This movie features an all-star cast of adult film actors but disappoints in delivering the expected level of engagement for this genre. Despite the presence of well-known performers, the scenes lack the excitement and appeal that viewers seek in such movies. Set in a mediocre medieval backdrop, the film's aesthetics come off as tacky and unimpressive. The acting is subpar, reminiscent of Keanu Reeves' performances, while the sex scenes fail to arouse any interest, akin to a mundane conversation with a neighbor about their child in college. The dialogues are poorly written, further diminishing the film's quality. The plot is weak and does little to redeem the overall viewing experience. Even the audio commentary, though typically unnecessary for this genre, adds no value. Unless you are a diehard fan of a specific adult film star, this movie offers little to entice viewers with a rating of 4/10."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find especially disappointing?,"If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Tony Scott's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting. Keira Knightley does get totally naked in this one though. That is the one and only upside to this film. If you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of nipple. I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER!</3",
What aspects of the movie made it unenjoyable for the reviewer?,"supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter. I'd say 95 % is fabricated. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film, something i can't stand, and to top it off, the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head. it's too incoherent, too flashy and way too boring, it's a who gives a crap kinda story, and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat's life.","The movie's heavy fabrication from the supposed true story, constant narration, unlikeable and arrogant heroine, incoherent plot, excessive flashiness, and overall boring execution made it a frustrating and unengaging experience for the reviewer. The reviewer expressed a strong distaste for movies that rely on such elements and suggested that big-time directors focus on creating original stories rather than based on real-life individuals."
What did you think of the film you recently watched?,"this film is really bad....... no i mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time. what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.<br /><br />now i love Mickey Rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few accidence's in his time and this is one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's a little too overrated. i just cant feel for her in films.<br /><br />all in all this film is bad. thats it....... 1/10.......j.d Seaton","The film was really bad, like, really really bad. The director, Tony Scott, is terrible. I only liked one of his films, ""Enemy of the State"". I can't believe Richard Kelly, who directed ""Donnie Darko"", was involved in this mess. Mickey Rourke couldn't save it with his performance, and Keira Knightly felt overrated. Overall, it's a 1 out of 10 from me."
What did you think of the plot of the movie?,"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?<br /><br />Terrible choice in casting, a convoluted, messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style. 1/5.",
What are some of the criticisms of the movie brought up by reviewers who were fans of Tony Scott films?,"I am, as many are, a fan of Tony Scott films. When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To find out that the movie it's the furthest thing from it! The story was treading water from the get go, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea. And the whole 'arm'scene was too gratuitous! <br /><br />The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever.<br /><br />I like Tony Scott's direction 'n all, but this takes the whole friggin cake! Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!","The reviewer expresses disappointment that the movie did not meet the high expectations set by Tony Scott's previous works like 'Man On Fire'. They felt let down by the weak storyline, the casting choice of Mickey Rourke, and found certain graphic scenes to be unnecessary. The reviewer was particularly critical of Keira Knightley's performance, stating that it revealed she may never become a successful movie star. Overall, the reviewer rated the movie 1 out of 10."
What makes this movie so unbearable to watch?,"This is a bad movie. Not one of the funny bad ones either. This is a lousy bad one. It was actually painful to watch. The direction was awful,with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly. Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all,and I cannot believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard. If you haven't seen it,don't. You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel .I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults. This one is just a waste of time.","In this movie, the direction is chaotic with poor color choices that make the characters appear sickly. The performances by the actresses like Keira Knightly are unconvincing, and the casting choices of Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke add to the disappointment. The script is awful, and the acting feels like nails on a chalkboard. It's recommended to steer clear of this film as it offers little value and will only leave you feeling like you've wasted your time."
What impact did the extensive use of still photographs have on the viewer's experience of Manufactured Landscapes?,"I recently viewed Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was drawn to the movie as a photographer because I'm both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I believe the movie does a good job getting it's message across, I couldn't help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by Burtynsky. Obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them. While this is a good effect when used economically, I felt like 75% of the movie was just stills from Burtynsky's book (which I already own). That's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one.","Although the movie effectively conveys its message, the heavy reliance on Burtynsky's still photographs, zooms, and pans left the viewer feeling like they were simply watching a slideshow of images from the popular book. This approach made the film seem like an afterthought to the photographs and might not be engaging for those already familiar with Burtynsky's work."
What is this documentary lacking in terms of visuals and storytelling?,"The movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers. My, what we've done to the planet you might think. I hope we get to see other things like this.<br /><br />That's very rare. When you're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations. It'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't. So, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera. Why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? It really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerk.<br /><br />I could read tips on how someone set up their camera, fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time.","The movie heavily relies on long shots of the narrator setting up his camera and presenting poorly filmed angles, which hinders the pacing and fails to showcase landscapes adequately. This repetition makes the narrator seem self-centered and detracts from the overall viewing experience."
What were the expectations vs reality in terms of the film's exploration of artistic beauty and nature?,"I was very excited about seeing this film, anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature, containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of ""Rivers and Tides."" However, that's not what I received. Instead, I get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature. Which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim.<br /><br />The photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed ""ethical"" duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images, along the periphery. And frankly, the images were not generally that impressive. And according to this ""artist,"" scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful.<br /><br />In all respects, a stupid film. For people who'd like to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but not for any one who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it.","The film did not meet the expectations set by the anticipation of a visually stunning exploration of the relationship between artistic beauty and nature. Instead, it presented a rather uninspired take on how human industry impacts nature, which was considered an unorthodox and lackluster claim. The conflict within the photographer in balancing aesthetic qualities and ethical considerations towards workers did not add depth to the film, and the images were not particularly impressive. The emphasis on scale as the basis for beauty was also criticized. Overall, the film was described as stupid and not suitable for those seeking a nuanced discussion on environmental issues."
"What are your thoughts on the movie ""The Return""?","holy Sh*t this was god awful. i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to gouge out my eyes much in the manor Oedipus Rex. dear god. this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff. please save your money, this movie can offer you nothing. unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you will be the only ones there anyway. F@ck this slide show. <br /><br />Ye Be Warned.<br /><br />I recommend not watching this.<br /><br />hello.<br /><br />how are you?<br /><br />I'm pretty good.<br /><br />enjoying this day?<br /><br />I am.<br /><br />this comment was one-hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie. this is sad.",
What makes this slasher film stand out despite its common premise and setting?,"A group of people are invited to there high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on. Now, he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines.<br /><br />Dark slasher film with an unexceptional premise. Bringing it up a notch are a few good performances, some rather creative death scenes, plenty of excitement & scares, some humor and an original ending.<br /><br />Unrated for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use.","The movie is a gory and intense experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with its creative death scenes, solid performances, and unexpected ending. The mix of horror, suspense, and humor adds to the overall enjoyment of the film."
Can you comment on the character development in the movie?,"What a terrible movie. The acting was bad, the pacing was bad, the cinematography was bad, the directing was bad, the ""special"" effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of badness in a slasher, but even the killings were bad.<br /><br />First of all, the past event that set up the motive for the slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of it and explained what happened well enough.<br /><br />Then, the victims were invited to the ""reunion"" in an abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on. One of the victims thought this was a little odd, but they dismissed it and decided to break in anyway.<br /><br />Finally, the killings were so fake as to be virtually unwatchable.<br /><br />There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to see some breasts, and not very good breasts at that. This movie makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.","The character development in this movie was extremely lacking. The characters were flat and one-dimensional, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them or care about their fates. There was no depth to their personalities, and their actions felt forced and unrealistic. Overall, the lack of character development detracted from the movie's overall impact and left viewers feeling uninvested in the story."
"What is your overall opinion on the movie ""Slaughter High""?","We all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe that's a bit hastey but damn if ""Slaughter High"" wasn't terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher flick. Pretty much, the plot involves a kid who experienced a Carrie-like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former-bullies who all show up to reminisce. As you'd expect, they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on April 1st by means of electrocution, burning, hanging, and chemically altered beer. I've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but considering the ending, I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time. Ignore any thought of viewing this movie...",
What are some of the familiar elements found in this slasher film that fans of the genre would appreciate?,"Another FRIDAY THE 13TH ripoff, even featuring some of its music! A group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la Jason Voorhees. Could it be that nerd they used to torment in school?<br /><br />Routine slash-fest is fun for fans of the genre, and contains the usual T&A quota for films if its ilk. The ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher.<br /><br />MPAA: Rated for violence/gore, language, sexuality, nudity, and some drug content.","This movie is just another unoriginal attempt to copy the success of FRIDAY THE 13TH, with recycled music and a predictable storyline. The characters are one-dimensional, and the only highlight seems to be the inclusion of the typical sex and violence scenes."
What issues did the reviewer have with the 1992 film 'The Lost World'?,"This was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make of Conan Doyle's famous novel 'The Lost World'. And it shows.<br /><br />The film starts promisingly enough, with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and Challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. Everybody is stranded on the plateau and we're left with a feeble, boring, over-length rehash of the first film.<br /><br />The dinosaurs (who are hardly ever seen) are just laughable. Are we expected to take that cuddly toy that's supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World. Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re-make.","The reviewer found the film to be a disappointing rehash of the first film, with laughable dinosaurs and a lackluster plot that pales in comparison to the 1925 silent version."
What are some shortcomings of the movie Born Again?,"Born Again is a sub-standard episode from season one. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn't fly. I've never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode. It does reference the Tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode. But the positives end there. Which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. And he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge. There's even a serious lack of witty Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat. If you're into reincarnation, maybe this episode is up your alley. If you're not, then at least you can learn what bradycardia is.","Born Again falls short due to its exploration of reincarnation, lack of engaging dialogue between Mulder and Scully, and the implausibility of certain character choices, making it a below-average episode in the series."
What makes this episode stand out as one of the worst in X-Files history?,Only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x-files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch.A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances.The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place.Mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge.Now for the bizarre bit.The little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation.I think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x-files history!,"The episode fails to generate any excitement, contains boring elements, and the theory presented by Mulder about the little girl's reincarnation lacks depth and feels like lazy writing."
How does Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 compare to the original film?,"I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorist's body, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US military, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island. Soon the infected locals turn into flesh-hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead. I did not find this film to be as good as the original film, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still an OK horror film with some good action. I did not think that it was one of the best in the series. 4/10","I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorist's body, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US military, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island.

What did you think of the movie Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci?,"First off I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci. This film was utter trash. I couldn't stand to watch it. The storyline was a joke, the acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke.<br /><br />We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People BACK TO LIFE. Whatever, this movie isn't worth the $1.00 it cost to rent it. I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be I think I will just skip them.<br /><br />Zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho.","The movie was utter trash, with a storyline and acting that were both a joke. The transition from Voodoo to a harmful agent bringing people back to life was too abrupt, and the fact that Zombi 3 had nothing to do with Zombi 2 just added to the disappointment. It definitely was not worth the $1.00 rental fee."
What aspect of the movie provides the only entertainment in an otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick?,"The dubbing/translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick. I haven't laughed so hard in my life as I just did watching Zombi 3 (and I've seen some really bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's just that funny.<br /><br />But... If falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a Fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea, then AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.","The dubbing and translation in this movie is the highlight, offering hilarity that could turn it into a successful comedy if re-edited. However, if you don't find amusement in this kind of humor, it's best to steer clear of Zombi 3."
What are some flaws in the movie portrayed in the review?,"Miraculously, this is actually quite watchable. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But whereas the original was so-bad-it's-ruining-my-life bad, this is so-bad-it's-mildly-entertaining bad. Right, that's enough faint praise. Production values are rotten across the board, the acting is excruciating and the Romero-wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it's mocking. Internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges, virus incubation times fluctuating as the 'plot' requires, bullets working against the zombies or not, zombies having the power of speech or not. Gore is the draw, obviously, but the framework is so slapdash it's annoying. The dialogue sounds like it's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals, and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of Romero's films. It's all topped off with a horrendous synth score. Absolute rubbish.","The movie has horrendous production values, excruciating acting, inconsistent internal logic, muddled satire, and a slapdash framework. The dialogue is poorly written, the scale of the zombie infestation lacks creativity, and the synth score is horrendous."
Can you share some negative aspects of the movie?,"I have two very major complaints regarding this film.<br /><br />1. That my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the ""suspense"" category. (Had I known what it was, I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft core porn.)<br /><br />2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. No one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two.<br /><br />Actually, make that three major complaints:<br /><br />3. That I for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list. Boy do I regret that. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This movie is valueless on virtually every level.","The movie is mistakenly categorized as suspense when it's actually soft-core porn, the title is misleading, not relevant to the movie's content, and the film offers no value on any level."
What makes this movie lack believability?,"My teacher taped this and showed it to us in Child Care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people. It just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny, unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such. I wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's (the carrier of the baby) mother is a riot. She is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window. Bobby's (the father) best friend's name is Dewey, and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is horrid, simply because none of the characters are believable. Thank goodness it's only made for TV, limiting the public's chances of viewing it.","The characters in this film are portrayed as unrealistic and exaggerated, with a storyline that fails to capture the true impact of teen pregnancy. The lack of authenticity in the characters' actions and relationships makes it difficult for viewers to connect or empathize with their journey. The overall execution of the movie falls short, making it a forgettable and unconvincing portrayal of its intended message."
"What was lacking in ""Batman Mystery of the Batwoman"" according to the review?","Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, stale. <br /><br />The plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante (""Batwoman"") is intruding on Batman's turf, and while Batman is trying to combat a Penguin/Bane/Rupert Thorne threesome, he's trying to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /><br />There is nothing strikingly wrong about this, but there is nothing really special about it either, noting really made it stick out. <br /><br />Mask of the Phantasm had Bruce's long lost love re surface and mess with his head.<br /><br />Subzero was a major event in the life of Mr Freeze. <br /><br />Even the Batman Beyond movie spin off, Return of the Joker, dug deep with the characters involved. <br /><br />But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in it's prime.","The review criticizes the movie for lacking deep character exploration and having a mundane plot compared to other Batman animated films. It mentions that the film feels more like a Scooby Doo episode in terms of excitement and depth, failing to capture the essence of the Dark Knight."
Is this Batman movie as dark and dramatic as some previous Batman films?,"I am a back Batman movie and TV fan. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not as great as some people were hopeing it to be. In my opinon, it is a big let down. I think the problem was it had no drama. Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero had some drama too. Also, I think this movie is to light for Batman. The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane at the end. Anyways, it's an ok Batman movie. But I would just rent it.","Despite being an okay Batman movie, it falls short on delivering the much-needed drama and dark elements that fans were hoping for. The lack of depth and intensity make it a letdown compared to other Batman movies like ""Mask Of The Phantasm"" and ""Return Of The Joker""."
How did the casting affect the overall impact of the movie?,"The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.","The story was considered trustworthy and powerful, with fine technical aspects and directing. However, the casting choices were criticized for turning the movie into a local cliché, lacking impact and leaving a low impression. With the exception of Rafael's character, played impressively by Asi Dayan, the other actors, especially Taly Sharon in the role of the elder Blind girl, were not at their best. Their performances were deemed mild and low profile, making some scenes feel more like rehearsals than part of a real movie. Improvements in casting were suggested for future projects."
What are some specific aspects of the film that make it difficult to enjoy for viewers who prefer movies with strong storytelling and skilled actors?,"I can't understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap splatter, you will love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - don't watch this. Personally i really disliked the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired straight from the street. The Dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next. The overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) we all had in mind, that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this, just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort. Another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam (very shaking) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone.","This movie falls short in delivering a compelling story and engaging performances from its actors. The dialogue feels flat and predictable, making it hard for audiences to get emotionally invested. The actors come across as amateurish, as if they were picked randomly off the street. Additionally, the low-quality production, shaky camerawork, and poor sound quality further detract from the overall viewing experience, giving the impression that it was hastily put together with minimal effort."
Did the movie accurately portray India as suggested in the synopsis?,"This movie was kind of interesting...I had to watch it for a college class about India, however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold, hard information on those details. It is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together. The gore factor is superb, however. Even right at the very beginning, you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense. Only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it. I've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events, however you can not find any information about it online...so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.","Despite the promise of the synopsis, this film falls short in providing substantial information related to India. Its attempt to tie the elements together at the end feels rushed and messy. The only redeeming quality lies in the graphic gore scenes that may appeal to some viewers. Overall, the thin plot may leave viewers feeling disappointed and regretful of investing their time in this movie. Moreover, the alleged real events that inspired the movie are unverifiable online, adding to the sense of wasted time."
What were some redeeming qualities of the movie despite its overall negative reception?,"Laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folks, but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen... I know it is low budget, but anyway: the actors behave like playing in a soap, the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies, but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worth listening to. The DVD cover promised a lot, but that is by far the best this film has to offer...","Despite receiving harsh criticism for its poor quality, the first three minutes of the movie were surprisingly interesting and visually decent. Additionally, the movie had a noteworthy score that added some value to the viewing experience. However, these elements were overshadowed by the soap-like acting, bad dialogues, and overall odd presentation that made it one of the worst movies the reviewer had ever seen."
What do parents and babysitters need to be cautious about with this movie?,"I was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at Wal-Mart earlier in the week. All three children actually got physically ill while watching it. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all had picked up from school, but really it could have been this film. Absolutely disgusting. How any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me. Fortunately, I turned off the film when I noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely. For any parents out there, I strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie.","The movie made three small children physically ill, possibly due to its content, prompting the babysitter to turn it off and advise parents against letting young children watch it."
What makes this movie so unbearable to watch?,"This movie was astonishing. It is beyond atrocious. I often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find awful movies to watch for their comedic value. My friend suggested this one, but as we watched it, people began to leave. I really wanted to finish it, just so that I could say that I had, but I was unable to. It's that bad. Horrible running gags, lame acting. The main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I would rather watch Costener's The Postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again. I think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with his tail, and then guffawing about it. It hurts. Watch it if you're an aspiring masochist, otherwise, leave this one alone.","The movie is described as a complete disaster, with horrendous running gags, subpar acting, and irritating characters like a clumsy dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. It fails to keep viewers engaged, leading many to leave the screening."
What happens when a cop in the future teams up with a talking dinosaur to stop a madman from starting another ice-age in the movie?,"From the What Was She Thinking? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice-age. Straight-to-tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high-concept in search of itself. Apparently this was a labor of love for its writer-director, Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); sadly, the end results are anemic, to be charitable. Goldberg's mere presence on-screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script, but here she's drowning and you can see the unfunny results. NO STARS from ****","Despite Whoopi Goldberg's usual ability to bring humor to any role, ""The Return"" falls short with an embarrassing and ridiculous storyline that leaves viewers cringing. The film struggles to find its identity, resulting in an anemic end product. Goldberg's presence isn't enough to save this disaster of a film."
"What makes ""Theodore Rex"" a particularly dreadful movie that even little kids would cringe at?","Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's dinner party, and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion going on. People just look at her and say, ""Oh what would YOU know, you were the star of 'Theodore Rex'"". How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap? Even little kids would be cringing in horror at this Thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund And The Sea Monsters'. Actually, come to think of it, 'Sigmund' was vastly superior to this.<br /><br />And however did it get made? By plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it? Watch this hideous abomination at your own peril.","The horrendous film ""Theodore Rex"" is described as an appalling piece of crap, comparable to a bad episode of ""Sigmund And The Sea Monsters"". The poor quality of the movie makes it difficult to understand how it was ever produced, leading one to wonder if the producer was under the influence of illegal substances when greenlighting the project."
What made this movie so unbearable to watch?,"I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I watched it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though. It's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.<br /><br />If you took the actual film, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more entertaining. Seriously.<br /><br />If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S-Mart, back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.","The movie was described as excruciatingly painful to sit through, even Joe Bob Briggs couldn't make it enjoyable. It was compared to watching your great grandmother flirt with a 15-year-old boy, and dipping the film in paint thinner would make it more entertaining."
Can a film be so bad that even Whoopi Goldberg wanted to get out of acting in it?,"There have been very few films I have not been able to sit through. I made it through Battle Field Earth no problem. But this, This is one of the single worst films EVER to be made. I understand Whoopi Goldberg tried to get of acting in it. I do not blame her. I would feel ashamed to have this on a resume. I belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face. Well it happens here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end!!!!!! Halfway through the film I was still looking for a plot. I never found one. Save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life.","This movie is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The humor falls flat, the special effects are laughable, and the lack of a coherent plot leaves the viewer scratching their head. Save yourself the agony of wasting 90 minutes of your life on this disaster of a film."
What aspects of the movie made it difficult to watch and unenjoyable?,"I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable.

Would you recommend this film to others?,"The only words you need fear more than Joe Don Baker if your thinking of watching a film are Greydon Clark , and if they are both there , run for your life . However this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously ! It starts out bad and goes downhill from there , repeated scenes , the Good The Bad and The Ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter .Yes , he's the best deputy sheriff in Texas , tracking a mafia hit-man to Malta as only he can . He makes his own rules , does things his own way , all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style . You want to see a bad but funny film ? Go ahead on , its your move !","The movie might advertise itself as a serious action-packed flick, but don't be fooled - it's a disaster waiting to happen. The acting is cringeworthy, the plot is all over the place, and the attempts at humor fall flat. Joe Don Baker's performance is not something you want to remember, and the cheesy action sequences will have you more confused than entertained. Save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this cinematic trainwreck."
What are some of the major flaws in this movie according to the reviewer?,"I can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984. It's got some laughable acting, not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever. Who would ever ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact, it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action/cop film as I can think of.<br /><br />I'm glad I only saw this on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. They remark on the female lead's resemblance to Elaine from Seinfeld (""None of them are spongeworthy"") and riff non-stop on Baker's weight. This movie probably isn't worse than ""Mitchell,"" but Baker's reputation definitely precedes him here: when his title comes up at the beginning of the film, Tom says, ""I wish I was illiterate so I wouldn't have to read that.""","The reviewer criticizes the laughable acting, absurd plot, and generic title of the movie. They also mention that the movie isn't much better than ""Mitchell"" and make fun of fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker's appearance throughout the film."
What controversial and uncomfortable scene stands out in this movie as the most memorable one for viewers?,"What reviewers and MST3K left out is the best part (and only memorable scene) of this otherwise dreadful movie: There is a very good rape-in-the-shower scene committed by the bad guy (Ben Gazzara look-alike) on Maria (as mentioned, killed later through T.J.'s ineptitude). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, ""prison mating ritual"" may be more appropriate. The background behind this chance, yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding ""Ben Gazzara,"" introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool. The 30-ish blonde disses him, but our villain must be quite smitten by her, because the courtship is on at that point. His first move is to attempt drowning her, until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off. Kind of like the girl in high school you didn't like, but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway... Let's just say, he catches UP with her in the cabana later.","The reviewer praises a disturbing scene involving a rape-in-the-shower committed by a character resembling Ben Gazzara, describing it as the only noteworthy part of an otherwise dreadful film. The scene is characterized as a forced ""prison mating ritual"" that depicts the villain's unsettling courtship of a blonde girl."
"What are some of the negative aspects of the movie ""Final Justice""?","Jimmy Dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish. Hysterical if viewed through the eyes of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which I rate as a 10. I mean, the sight of this obese, corn-fed hog trouncing around Malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory, if you make it that far into the film. This ugly, hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of ""Booty Call"", ""Pumpkinhead"", ""Swarm"", and ""The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh"". A -gulp- film like this proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. get behind on their mortgage, or get stoned to the point of insanity. It begs the question ""who was so stupid to finance such a whale?"" But then, had good judgment prevailed and ""Final Justice"" never was, then we wouldn't have the delightful spoof voice-over in ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000""!","The movie ""Final Justice"" is criticized for its over-the-top and loutish performance by Jimmy Dean, which some viewers found absurd and nauseating. The film is described as an ugly farce that can be compared to low-quality movies like ""Booty Call"" and ""The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh"". It is suggested that the movie may have been made due to financial struggles or lack of good judgment, raising questions about who would finance such a poorly received film."
Can you tell me the biggest flaws of this movie and why it didn't meet your expectations?,"I guess this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck. The concept of the film wasn't very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it I don't know where to start. The acting is horrible. The cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There's a reason why this movie ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this ""film"" is excellent. They must have liked the two go-go dancers. Final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves.","This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film. The acting was atrocious, the cinematography was subpar, and the soundtrack was unbearable. It's no wonder this movie ended up being mocked on Mystery Science Theater 3000. With a rating of 1 out of 10, this movie truly deserves to be locked away and never seen again."
What is the general tone of the movie and how does it portray the protagonist?,"Joe Don's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker tracking down an Italian mobster. Joe Don's character is named Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over agin. Everyone in the movie hates him, just like everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked an earlier Greydon picture, ""Angel's Revenge"" because it was a shirne for thriteen year old boys. Avoid this movie at all costs!!","The movie sets a compelling tone right from the start through Joe Don's character, Geronimo, who is relentless in his pursuit of an Italian mobster on the island of Malta. The action-packed scenes keep you engaged as Geronimo uses his wit and gun skills to track down his target. The tension builds up as he faces various obstacles and enemies in his mission. The character development of Geronimo is intriguing and keeps you rooted for him till the end."
What are some criticisms about the lead character and the script in the movie?,"Sergio Leone spins in his grave... If there was any film that tramples upon a man's life work its this one. The lead character's ""lone wolf"" bravado is uninspiring and lame, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education. Whoever's idea this was should be horse whipped. The only reason I'm spending time trashing it is because there's a 10 line minimum. Sergio Leone's family should sue, not because its crap, but because now it's immortalized as crap by MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood...at least Gary Busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts...this film is pure blasphemy.","The lead character's ""lone wolf"" bravado was described as uninspiring and lame, while the script was compared to being written by a monkey with an eighth-grade education."
What makes Final Justice an entertaining movie featuring Joe Don Baker?,"Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he's off to Malta where he shoots more people. He gets locked up many times for shooting people. Then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy, who is dressed like a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don winds up in jail again. Finally Joe Don, with the help from Elaine from ""Seinfeld"" kill the bad guy, blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare. All this and a catchy theme song, just like Mitchell!","Final Justice is a thrilling action-packed film where Joe Don Baker goes on a relentless shooting spree in Texas and Malta, with a boat chase, a clash with a monk-dressed villain, and an explosive finale. The addition of Elaine from ""Seinfeld"" adds a fun element to the movie, along with a catchy theme song reminiscent of classic action films like Mitchell."
"What was the best part of the movie ""Shakti: The Power""?","What a boring film! To sum it all up, its was basically just Nana Patekar beating up his daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to flee from the village, with her son. Can someone say BORING??? The concept wasn't too bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian locales, and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. However, overall the cinematography came up short. The story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to drag on. There is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours of it.<br /><br />The best part of the whole movie was the song ""Ishq Kamina"", and that was only five minutes long. Other than that, this movie was a piece of crap.","The movie was a boring watch with a poorly executed concept. Nana Patekar's character beating up Karisma Kapoor's character while she tried to escape with her son felt dragging and filled with stupidity. The cinematography fell short despite some nicely shot Canadian and village scenes. The only highlight was the song ""Ishq Kamina"", which was only five minutes long, making the rest of the movie feel like a piece of crap."
Did the movie utilize Eva's comedic skills to their full potential?,With movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts. Eva as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors also do a good job. It is the direction and the story that is lacking. That could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better. The problem only is that there aren't many jokes. Sure I laughed a couple of times. Apart from the talking parrot there wasn't an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie. I blame the director not using the premise to it's full potential. Eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so. Overall this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Other than that it can be skipped completely.,"The movie had a promising cast with Eva showcasing her comedy talent as a ghost. However, the lack of creativity in the story and direction failed to fully utilize her skills. The humor fell short with only a few laughs, leaving much to be desired. The movie missed the opportunity to make the most of its premise, making it a forgettable experience that could be easily skipped."
What is the premise of the movie and who are the main characters involved in the story?,"The lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the ""I do's"" with fiancé Henry(Paul Rudd). After two years Henry has yet to move on and his sister Chloe(Lindsay Sloane)is very concerned. Chloe arranges for Henry to talk with an attractive psychic Ashley(Lake Bell). Ashley is to contact Kate's spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life. When the psychic starts getting attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost appears to nip the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker. And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt. Still this movie was over-hyped.","The movie ""The Return"" features the talented Eva Longoria Parker as Kate, who tragically dies before her wedding to Henry, played by Paul Rudd. Two years later, Henry is still unable to move on, leading his sister Chloe, portrayed by Lindsay Sloane, to intervene by setting up a meeting between Henry and a psychic named Ashley, played by Lake Bell. However, things take a complicated turn when Ashley begins to develop feelings for Henry, and Kate's ghost appears to complicate matters further. Despite some humorous moments, the film heavily relies on what was already revealed in the trailers, and the performances by Bell and Biggs overshadow Parker's. Overall, the movie feels over-hyped and lacking substance."
What are some flaws in the movie 'Over Her Dead Body'?,"Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' poorly. The idea is first of all, is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film. Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane.<br /><br />I expected entertainment more from this film. Sadly, I didn't get entertained.","The movie 'Over Her Dead Body' falls short due to poor writing and direction by Jeff Lowell. The plot is unoriginal and the execution is disappointing. The only saving grace is Eva Longoria Parker's performance, as the rest of the cast seems uninspired. Paul Rudd appears disinterested, Lake Bell is miscast and underwhelming, and the talents of Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloane are wasted. Overall, the film fails to deliver the expected entertainment value."
What similarities does this movie have with Noel Coward's play 'Blithe Spirit'?,"This movie is similar to the play entitled 'Blithe Spirit' written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to Coward's writing. I'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original writer's concept. I realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is.<br /><br />Sad. These movies are so expensive to produce. I do perk up when a screenplay is original. I even perk up when it's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released. There were some samples mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /><br />I realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I'm not please when the public's taste is taken for granted. In this situation, the public's taste is overlooked.<br /><br />I look forward to better produced movie entertainment.<br /><br />In this case. I rather see the play.","The movie is seen as a knockoff of Noel Coward's original concept, which is disappointing to those who appreciate originality in screenplays. The lack of acknowledgment towards the original writer's concept leaves a sour taste, and the movie's production cost doesn't justify the lack of creativity displayed. It fails to cater to the public's appetite for authentic and innovative storytelling, leaving viewers yearning for better quality entertainment."
Do you think this movie will appeal to a wide audience?,"Was this the greatest movie that I have ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No.<br /><br />As a mother of four kids, it is nice to watch something that was light and amusing. It was great, but it was cute.<br /><br />I think that it definitely had some room to improve, but it tried.<br /><br />I am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer. They obviously do not care for Eva Longoria. I think that she was better in this than in The Sentinel. I think that movies are a matter of opinion. The actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop.<br /><br />Maybe the cast did not work out. Maybe there were too many things going on.<br /><br />I just wanted to speak up for an average movie, not a terrible one. It could just be a chick flick. Kind of like the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband still talks about those. :)","This movie seems to be a hit with families and those looking for a light and amusing watch. While it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it provides a cute and enjoyable experience, especially for mothers with kids. However, there are hints of areas where it could have been better and some viewers may find the cast and plot a bit chaotic."
What are some specific flaws in the casting and acting in the movie?,"This movie is one of the worst ones of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. It's like she knows nothing about acting. All her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />As for the story, it is so cookie cutter. It goes from point A to B with little surprise. So much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth watching.","The main characters lack chemistry, with Eva Longoria's performance being described as horrible and lacking any sense of acting. Lake Bell's portrayal shows minimal emotion and seems robotic. Only Paul Rudd is highlighted as having any talent."
Can you give more details about what made this movie so terrible?,"I had to shut this off after about 15 execrable moments..<br /><br />I was hoping it might improve,<br /><br />What I saw was badly acted, directed & written.<br /><br />This movie should never even have been released directly to DVD,.<br /><br />The lead character who is a bride top be from HELL has an huge Ice sculpture fall on her killing her. She was such a revolting person I was not even sorry for her. She winds up there in a sort of heaven, & was still repulsive, I left shortly after.<br /><br />Eve Longoria portrays her & I hope I never see her again, she cant even act.She is just plain annoying.<br /><br />Paul Rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud.<br /><br />Jason Biggs ( no longer a teen) is also present,<br /><br />I do like comedies BUT not stupid ones about stupid people.<br /><br />Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)","The movie was a disaster from start to finish, with terrible acting, poor direction, and a nonsensical plot. The lead character, played by Eve Longoria, was so unlikeable that even her demise couldn't garner any sympathy from the audience. The presence of usually reliable actors like Paul Rudd and Jason Biggs couldn't save this film from being a complete dud. The attempt at comedy fell flat, leaving viewers with a sense of frustration and disappointment. The movie's rating of 1 out of 4 stars and a measly 30 points out of 100 accurately reflect its lackluster quality."
Did the movie live up to expectations with its decent actors?,"this movie was terrible. i thought with all the some what decent actors, it would be better. don't waste your time. Eva longoria parker was awful. she should stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd is becoming a B actor. the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i'm saying. and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons. watch just like heaven with Reese Witherspoon...it was a tad better. or any other ghost movie. you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time. PS i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance! time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it.","This movie was terrible. The actors, including Eva Longoria Parker and Paul Rudd, failed to deliver, with Longoria Parker's performance being particularly awful. It's a waste of time to watch this film, and you'd be better off watching something else like ""Just Like Heaven"" or ""P.S. I Love You"" for a better movie experience."
What did you think about the character of Eva Longoria in the movie?,"Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her. She is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her.<br /><br />Obvious unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clichéd sort of way, except that Longoria's character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film. Its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be fair Longoria, nor anyone else in the cast or crew, isn't the problem, its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings. Its just really really stupid.",The character of Eva Longoria in this film is obnoxious and drains all the fun out of the movie. She ruins the watching experience and makes it feel like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper.
What made you feel so disengaged from the movie that you decided to leave the theater?,"i didn't even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min. of that movie again i think I'm going to shoot myself...and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i wasn't surprised at all i mean who didn't know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that. i know i didn't miss anything and if somebody ask's me to see that movie i would say ""over my dead body"".",The movie was so boring and predictable that I couldn't even make it through without feeling like I was going to fall asleep. My friends and I left midway through and I have no intention of ever watching it again.
What is the overall tone of the review?,"You know you are in trouble watching a comedy, when the only amusing parts in it are from the Animal cast. It is a pity then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support & not the other way around, as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout.<br /><br />If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what sort of name is that), Jason, & Lindsay, I would forget this acting lark & do something else, as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry, & awful actors to boot.<br /><br />The main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is funny as if you weren't, you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy, tedious & dare I say very plain women leads in the film.<br /><br />The worst film I have seen in years, & hopefully never see one as bad again, though I expect not.","The reviewer had a negative experience watching the movie, finding the human actors abysmal and unamusing, emphasizing on the lack of humor and the subpar performances by the cast."
What do you think about the acting in this movie?,"This really was the worst movie I have ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry. The cover of the DVD does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is. Really, really boring. I had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good? hhaha they literally just like talk and say ""yeah"" and there is no passion whatsoever. I could not tell at all that they were in love. I'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I have ever seen.",The acting in this movie was atrocious. The main actress was incredibly unconvincing and had zero chemistry with the rest of the cast. It felt like they were just reciting lines without putting any emotion or effort into their performances. It was painful to watch and made it hard to believe in any of the relationships or emotions portrayed on screen. Definitely one of the worst performances I have seen in a movie.
What are some of the shortcomings of the film according to the review?,"Sure, it had some of the makings of a good film. The storyline is good, if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though I didn't understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the US. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. I know as rule, the average American is considered a frumpy dresser by any self-respecting European but this was beyond that. Anna's colour combinations were positively ghastly!! And that potato sack-like, sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives. I suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk around in Prada?) but simple doesn't mean an absolute lack of taste. A word to the wise...","The reviewer found fault with the wardrobe choices in the movie, criticizing the unappealing color combinations and the unflattering coat worn by the main character. The reviewer also questioned the authenticity of the character's accent, pointing out inconsistencies in her background."
What elements of the film fall short in creating an engaging viewing experience for the audience?,"Look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com with an ending you can see coming before you've seen so much as the trailer. The key difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension. This movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement, you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment. The production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago. I'd recommend re-watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow imitation. Oh, one other BIG problem...no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael looking all cute as Vaughn in Alias, you're going to be seriously disappointed with the way they've made him look here.","The movie's lack of originality and predictability in its storyline, coupled with a sense of stagnation and amateurish production quality, make it a forgettable and unexciting watch. Additionally, the absence of chemistry between the main characters, particularly a disappointing portrayal of the lead actor, fails to engage the audience emotionally."
What are some flaws in the movie that make it unenjoyable to watch?,"Poorly structured, badly written, loaded with cliches and flat dialogue. Not a single scene shines. The actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises, plot twists or conflict. You know from the first ten minutes where it's going.<br /><br />For a movie set in NY, it has almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget. This one seems like it was shot in Toronto.<br /><br />If you cast Natasha Henstridge, why dress her in baggy sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and drab? Where's the attraction? I felt like I was watching a sub-par Christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizing.<br /><br />Steven Feder's big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie.","The movie is poorly structured, badly written, and filled with cliches and flat dialogue. The actors struggle with a dull scenario lacking in surprises, plot twists, or conflicts. The film lacks any feeling for the setting of New York City and fails to capture its magic. Overall, the movie feels like a subpar Christian movie of the week, with uninteresting character appearances and a lack of on-screen chemistry."
"Is ""It had to be You"" a movie worth watching?",""" It had to be You"" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson a former police officer turned Author. When Charlie's fiancé goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning. He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married. The two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together. This is when the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch.","""It had to be You"" is a prime example of Hollywood's lack of creativity. The movie follows the cliché storyline of a man falling in love with someone other than his fiancée while planning their respective weddings. The performances by the lead actors, Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge, are bland and unimpressive, adding to the overall disappointment of the film. This romantic comedy offers nothing new or exciting, leaving viewers eagerly anticipating the end so they can move on to more engaging content."
What is the central conflict in the movie?,"Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film really never gets going. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finch's late father whose ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way. The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with Finch.","While the film boasts stunning visuals and a talented cast including Elizabeth Taylor, the story fails to captivate the audience. The plot feels stagnant, leaving Taylor's character unfulfilled and overshadowed by the underdeveloped relationships and the somewhat forced supernatural element involving the plantation's history with elephants."
How faithful is the movie adaptation to the book?,"the author of the book, by the same title, should not have let her name be used for this movie. if you have read the book, this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details. the movie adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the book's own literary achievement.<br /><br />for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it doesn't offer anything more while it is moving slowly (like character development, for example). some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie, but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle--its fairly tame and not imaginative at all.","The movie takes a very liberal approach in interpreting the events of the book, deviating significantly from its spirit and essence. If you're expecting a faithful adaptation, you'll be highly disappointed as the movie adds little to no artistic value to the original literary work."
Can you think of another movie that seems very similar to this one?,"I'm not sure how related they are, but I'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story that it's based on). Very similar plotline, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see that one instead.<br /><br />This one moves very slowly, but being a late 60s French movie, that is to be expected of the style. Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school. The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first, particularly since the audio from each overlaps (ie, hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa). Also, the ""girls"" are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school. Finally, not much character development to even get you attached to the movie.","Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see that one instead. This movie moves very slowly, typical of late 60s French films, and the editing of flashbacks with current scenes can be a bit confusing. The characters are not very developed, and the actresses seem a bit old to portray students in a boarding school."
"What are some aspects of ""Titanic"" that the reviewer was critical of?","I, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97. It was a below average film at best, defiantly not the ""masterpiece"" that all these ""Titanic"" fanboys like to make it out as. First off, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his looks. His acting ""skills"" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship they're on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever. Nor is it original. Plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. I could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, ""Titanic"" is the most overrated movie to date. Why it got so much attention and money is beyond me.","The reviewer expressed disappointment in Leonardo DiCaprio's acting, labeling it as cheesy and unimpressive. Additionally, they found the plot to be boring and simple, consisting of cliched love scenes and not offering anything ingenious or original. They also criticized the length of the film, feeling that it was unnecessarily drawn out to over 3 hours. Ultimately, the reviewer concluded that ""Titanic"" was highly overrated and could have been condensed into a much shorter runtime."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find particularly disappointing?,"What a piece of junk this movie was. The premise was okay, but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people (even the effects in Hercules was better) I knew this would be bad. But the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs. It's completely incoherent, silly and stupid. I felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a D-. I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie through.<br /><br />I've had my share of cheesy and bad movies (I love the tremors series), but this... I do not recommend it at all. It's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe.","The reviewer found the premise to be lacking, criticized the poor special effects, and overwhelmingly disliked the incoherent and silly dialogues which they felt were akin to something a 9th grader would write. They also expressed frustration towards the actors for being a part of this movie."
"Why is ""The fallen ones"" considered a waste of life movie by the reviewer?","""The fallen ones"" falls under the waste of life (WOL) category. I am sad that I am now two hours older was not entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without any loss of plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges. Later after everything was screwed up by the evil people. The heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong.","The reviewer expresses disappointment in ""The fallen ones"", indicating that it was not entertaining and even received demeaning comments from their family members while watching. They suggest that the movie lacked flavor and could have been condensed to a shorter duration without losing any plot. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the size of the mummy character and suggests changes to the plot that would have made it more engaging."
What aspect of the movie did the viewer find particularly unrealistic or ridiculous?,"Some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to Earth, decided to disregard what he'd heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans. Reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall, is beyond ridiculous. There was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world, that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans. These were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human, somewhat supporting the ""David and Goliath"" tale from the bible. There is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being. If I was rating this movie on my own scale, it would have been a negative value instead of a one...","The viewer found the portrayal of angels as 40 feet tall giants to be beyond ridiculous and unsupported by historical references, leading to a negative overall rating."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find lacking?,"I came into this movie really wanting to line it. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Don't get me wrong here, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane, I was taking this for the B movie that it is. That said, it still fell short of the expectation. The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold. The acting in the movie was very wooden. All in all I give it 4 for a great idea, but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals. Is it worth seeing? I didn't wish for my two hours back, but I don't know that I'd recommend it to others.","The reviewer expressed disappointment in the historical aspect being glossed over and found the ending unsatisfactory. Additionally, they criticized the wooden acting and felt that more attention to basic filmmaking principles could have significantly improved the movie. Overall, while the reviewer appreciated the potential in the premise, they did not wholeheartedly recommend the film."
What made the music in the movie unbearable to listen to?,"...from this awful movie! There are so many things wrong with this film, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. that it's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst. The music! I noted that the film has two composers listed. This must be the reason why every single frame has music, of the absolute worst ""D"" movie style drivel. They have never heard of the expression ""less is more"". It got so painful to listen to, I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was that good. You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers. See it at your own risk.","The music in this film was extremely poorly composed, with constant drivel playing in every frame. It was so bad that I had to mute the sound whenever there was no dialogue."
What is the overall pacing and focus of the movie?,"An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) stumbles accidentally upon an ancient, 40 foot mummy, well preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this a secret and call in a Jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in ""those days"". In order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything, he mummifies his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to awaken him years from then. In our present, the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place. Most of the movie is slow, having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy, air-punching fights. The mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough. It should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so... eh. Don't bother.","The movie is slow-paced and focuses too much on biblical elements, leading to a lackluster viewing experience. The fight scenes are unimpressive and the mummy is not showcased adequately, making the film feel dragged out and ultimately not worth watching."
What made this film disappointing to watch?,"Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a football. Unfortunately, it didn't make the goal. The historical subject of giants is a good one, but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese. I say, take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff. I couldn't even watch the entire film. That says a lot because I rarely walk away from any movie. I always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption. It's impossible to redeem something this bad. Well, at least the acting was good....NOT! <br /><br />The only thing ""falling"" in this film is the rating. 1/10 and sinking into the negative numbers!","The film is described as a giant wheel of cheese that should be rolled off a cliff. The reviewer couldn't even watch the entire movie despite rarely walking away from any movie. The historical subject of giants was poorly executed, and even the acting was criticized. The overall rating given was 1/10, indicating an extremely negative experience."
What are some key elements of the movie that failed to impress the audience?,"This movie is trash-poor. It has horrible taste, and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real-events - which doesn't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment. Direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out-of-place. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To start, Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device. You have an older Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting ""d_ck_smker"" - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the Williams character. Finally you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel adviser to Williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end. Toni Collete's character is just plain annoying and a re-hash of her 6th Sense performance with poorer direction. Very Miss-able.","The movie received negative reviews for its tasteless script, unconvincing performances, and poorly executed direction. The plot points, including a pedophile story and uninteresting relationships, were criticized for being baseless and out-of-place. Overall, the film was deemed missable due to its lack of engaging characters and its failed attempts at humor."
What aspect of the movie did the reviewer find disappointing?,I felt that the movie was dry... very disappointing no plot..kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone.. a wast of money.. One of Robins Williams worst films..if you don't believe me wait a few months it will be out on DVD because that seems to be a pattern for movies that don't do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over... This is one you will not want to see or say why did I spend my money on that!. Plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it.... This was on a Friday night the 9:50 showing. I also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake. When they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying..,"The movie was described as dry, lacking a plot, and ultimately a waste of money. The reviewer criticized it as one of Robin Williams' worst films and mentioned the low attendance in the theater. The lack of excitement and unclear dialogue were also highlighted as negative points."
What elements of the movie failed to engage the viewer and left them feeling bored?,"My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan. I like him too, but have generally found that he should ""stick to what he does best"" and focus on comedic roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored throughout the entire film. The story was predictable. I realize it was inspired by a true story. But, my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story. None of the characters were well developed. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been explored further. More important, though, would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the ""boy"". Her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into. She obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way. If my husband wasn't such a huge Williams fan, we would have left 20 minutes into it. Too bad I can't get my $20 or 2 hours back.","The movie was predictable, the characters were underdeveloped, and missed opportunities for deeper exploration of key relationships and character backgrounds left the viewer wanting more."
What technical aspect of the film constantly distracts the viewer?,"Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film hold true.<br /><br />BUT .... If I have to sit through a movie were the:<br /><br />Director<br /><br />Director of Photography<br /><br />Editor<br /><br />Can't EVEN miss the darn Microphone Boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every Chapter of the movie, how can I enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when I'm reminded of the technicalities of making a movie!!!!!!!<br /><br />WAIT FOR THE DVD OR DON'T BOTHER","The constant presence of the microphone boom in nearly every chapter of the movie detracts from fully enjoying and immersing oneself in the story, making it hard to believe in the film's authenticity and overall quality. The recommendation is to either wait for the DVD release or skip it altogether."
Do you think this movie lives up to the expectations of Hitchcock fans?,"Trying to compare or represent this ""swill"" as anything ""Hitchcockian"" is an out-n-out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to waste $7 on this movie... Weak acting Weak story Weak script. <br /><br />No real suspense, no thrills. You wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any payoff...You're left thinking, what the heck was that all about.<br /><br />And please, enough with the movement to make ""alternative lifestyles"" HIP and politically correct!!...I can't recommend this to anyone...Did I mention how weak the acting is? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and ""Mork"". But those were MUCH more innocent times...........","The movie failed to deliver on suspense or thrills, with weak acting, story, and script. It lacks any real payoff and attempts to incorporate ""alternative lifestyles"" feel forced and politically correct. Overall, it's not recommended and the acting is particularly criticized."
Can you identify the elements in the movie that made it a mess and boring for the audience?,This movie is a mess. I'm surprised it even has a theatrical release. WIthout Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video. It is poorly written. It is poorly directed. It's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic.Especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it. Save your money. The trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills - in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring.,
What were some major flaws in the movie?,I would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered.<br /><br />Why I didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie I cannot say. I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately!! Several people in our theater did and sadly I didn't follow them out.<br /><br />The story lacked all criteria for a movie. NO plot. Awful acting! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I may never see another film he is in. Not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk. I did like the tazer scene. Too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot. Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film!,"The story lacked coherence, had no plot, and the acting was terrible, even by well-known actors like Robin Williams. The relationships in the movie fell flat, and the tazer scene was the only somewhat redeeming moment. Overall, the film was a huge disappointment, and I wished I had walked out like others did."
Did this movie live up to the expectations of being a thriller or horror film according to the reviewer?,"I usually come on this website prior to going to the movies, as I like to see what other people think of the movie. I read many reviews which said 'thriller not a horror movie'. This prompted me to give this film a try. I really must take issue with these 'thriller/horror' statements, as it was neither! I almost went and asked for my money back, and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish....well you must be easily pleased! At the end of the movie, the people behind me said out loud ""what a waste of time"" and I turned to them and replied "" I couldn't have summed it up better"". I kept waiting for something to happen...but it didn't. There was the potential for a lot of good scares (or thrills if you like) but none happened. Williams acted the part quite well but I felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere. Save your money folks, this is a turkey which will be featuring at a DVD store 'bargain box' near you in the very foreseeable future!","The reviewer was highly disappointed with the movie, stating that it neither met the expectations of being a thriller nor a horror. They felt that the film was a waste of time with no good scares or thrills, and the script was poor, leaving the audience unsatisfied. The reviewer advised others to save their money and considered the movie to be a disappointment that will likely end up in discount DVD stores soon."
What are some positive aspects of the movie mentioned in the review?,This movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good. I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. The book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it. Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up. I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams. <br /><br />The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD.,
What are the key factors that led to the downfall of Mel Brooks's sense of humor in this movie?,"Another chapter in the ongoing question, whatever happened to Mel Brooks's sense of humor? It starts out nicely enough, with Mel as Trump-like mogul Goddard Bolt (""You can call me God""), who accepts a bet that he can't live on the streets for 30 days. But the moment the movie hits the streets, it turns into a pathos-laden mess, with occasional ""funny"" bits interjected (Mel sees a black kid break-dancing for money and tries to do a vaudeville buck-and-wing, yuk, yuk). Leslie Ann Warren is nothing short of wasted. The worst part is this movie's musical number, in which Brooks and Warren do a silent dance to Cole Porter's ""Easy to Love."" Brooks's musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies; here he plays the whole thing straight, like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" (on which Rudy DeLuca, this film's co-writer, began his career). Go rent Charlie Chaplin's THE KID, which covered the same ground 70 years before and did a lot","The movie starts off promising with Mel Brooks in the role of a Trump-like mogul who takes on a challenge to live on the streets, but quickly spirals into a messy and unsatisfying narrative. The attempts at humor feel forced, particularly in a cringeworthy scene involving a black kid break-dancing. Leslie Ann Warren's talent is wasted in this film. The musical number, typically a highlight in Brooks's movies, falls flat as he opts for a serious approach that lacks the usual charm and wit of his parodies. Overall, this film fails to deliver on the engaging comedy expected from Mel Brooks."
"Was ""September"" by Mel Brooks well received by critics and audiences?","Woody Allen made ""September"", proving that even a genius could screw up. This is Mel Brook's ""September"". Monumentally stupid, boring, and unfunny, I must confess I did not watch it through to the end. The flick ranks among the dishonored few (e.g., ""The Money Pit"", ""Out to Sea"", ""Spitfire Grill"") which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the ""rewind"" button. And I say this, sadly, as a devoted Mel Brooks fan. He should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone. How the same fellow that made ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Spaceballs"" could crank out a dog like this is beyond me. To be avoided at all costs.","""September"" by Mel Brooks disappointed many fans who found it to be monumentally stupid, boring, and unfunny. The film was so unenjoyable that some viewers couldn't even watch it until the end, comparing it to other forgettable movies that put them to sleep or made them reach for the ""rewind"" button. It seems that Mel Brooks should stick to his strengths in straight comedy and steer clear of attempting social commentary, as this film was a major letdown for devoted fans."
Can you think of any redeeming qualities of this film?,"I have done quite a few reviews on IMDb and this film is unique in that I never saw the entire movie. It was so terribly stupid and unfunny that I just couldn't sit through it--though I tried.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie I call ""the Mel quotient"". In other words, the better his movie, the less of him you see in the film. Think about it--The Producers and Young Frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all. BUT, films like Life Stinks and Space Balls are chock full of Mel and are pretty dopey movies (yes, I DID NOT LIKE Space Balls--but this isn't the place to talk about that).<br /><br />Second, apart from cancer, rectal itch and mental retardation, I can't think of a less funny topic than homelessness. This is just a comedy breaker. Think about it, folks. The FUNNIEST(?) scene in the movie has Mel making whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster!! And this is funny in what way?","The film was a total letdown, filled with stupidity and lacking any humor that would make it worth watching. The topic of homelessness was terribly unfunny, and even the performances of the actors couldn't save it. The humor made no sense, with absurd scenes like Mel Brooks engaging in intimate acts in a dumpster."
What makes Hobgoblins a standout film in terms of its entertainment value despite its flaws?,"Hobgoblins....Hobgoblins....where do I begin?!?<br /><br />This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst film ever made. This one is fun to laugh at, where as Manos was just painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term: ""80's cheeze"". The acting (and I am using this term loosely) is atrocious, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see, and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed. The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to watch this mess. This movie gives Mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they have ever done. If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the bots.....God help you!!",
What makes this movie so unbearable to watch?,"How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion. This film is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie I thought Manos: Hands of Fate was the worse piece of crap I ever saw, but at least Manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep, thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer. The greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the Hobgoblins ""locked"" up makes it to the final scene. The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life.","The movie is a complete disaster, making even the slow Manos: Hands of Fate seem like a better option. The time spent watching it feels like a total waste of life."
"What makes ""Hobgoblins"" a standout in the realm of bad movies?","****MINOR SPOILERS*** As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet ""Hobgoblins"" stands apart from all others in it's own unique way. Classic baddies such as ""The Creeping Terror,"" ""The Mighty Gorga"" and ""Manos"" are uniformly bad from start to finish. ""Hobgoblins"" on the other hand, starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept ""Club Scum"" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. With just this one film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Watch ""Hobgoblins"" and wonder no longer.","""Hobgoblins"" is not just your average bad movie, it takes bad to a whole new level. From a disastrous rake fight scene to the painfully unfunny ""Club Scum"" sequence, director Rick Sloane cements his place among the worst directors of all time with this film. If you want to witness the epitome of a bad movie, look no further than ""Hobgoblins."""
What makes Hobgoblins stand out from other movies that have been accused of ripping off popular films like Gremlins?,"If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins, then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies. These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams - oh joy), but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica. They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell, one suspects. There's no real plot - just ""goblins - kill!"" and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience.","Hobgoblins takes a nosedive into the realm of absurdity with barely-animated creatures, a nonsensical plot centered around fulfilling sexual fantasies, and feeble attempts at humor, leaving viewers scratching their heads at the director's peculiar choices."
What makes Hobgoblins a movie that should be avoided?,"This movie is so bad, it's comical. In fact, Mystery Science Theatre 3000, the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this very film to mock. I suggest watching it (maybe on YouTube) instead of actually seeing this movie.<br /><br />Please, do not see Hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene. Actually, do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. Its jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie.<br /><br />You may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching, so spare yourself. Read a book. Do the laundry. Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.","The movie is so terrible that it has been mocked on the show Mystery Science Theatre 3000, with its jokes failing to land and likely leaving viewers feeling unimpressed and even sick. It is recommended to steer clear of this film and find other entertainment options instead."
Can you describe a movie that you found truly awful and unbearable to watch?,"I once thought that ""The Stoned Age"" was the worst film ever made... I was wrong. ""Hobgoblins"" surpassed it in every way I could imagine and a few I couldn't. In ""The Stoned Age"" I hated the characters. In ""Hobgoblins"" I hated the actors... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity. I won't include a teaser to this film, I'm not that cruel. I couldn't subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment. In fact, any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning. Words I would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid, asinine, and ingenuous.<br /><br />In conclusion, PLEASE don't watch this film. I beg of you, from one movie lover to another... no, from one human being to another, PLEASE. For the sake of your own sanity and intellect DO NOT WATCH IT. Destroy any copies you come across.","""Hobgoblins"" is a disaster of a film, surpassing even the previously deemed worst movie ""The Stoned Age."" The characters are insufferable, the actors are unwatchable, and the plot is absolutely senseless. Watching this atrocity is a true test of one's sanity and intellect. Avoid at all costs."
What are some qualities of this movie that might lead a viewer to find it unbearable to watch?,"Description: Corny, utterly stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame, it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (I'm guessing this...) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I am giving you the best advice in the world:<br /><br />Spare yourself, spare your time, life, and money, by NOT--I repeat, NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie. This movie is so corny, it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You might actually admire it. (Like I said before, IF you have a one-digit IQ)<br /><br />With about 12 actors of your own, a few puppets you bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I gaurentee you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap.","The reviewer found the movie to be corny, utterly stupid, and worthless. They criticized it for being cheaply made, having questionable budget allocation, and lacking entertainment value. The reviewer strongly advised against watching the movie, emphasizing its poor quality and suggesting that viewers with a low IQ might appreciate it."
"What elements of ""Hobgoblins"" make it fall short as a movie?","this is the result. A piece of trash movie that doesn't deserve to even be classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of stuff on a film reel, that makes no sense whatsoever. Well back to the actors, which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film. Well it's a great horror anyway, nevermind being a film. There's plenty of horrific acting in ""Hobgoblins,"" but the worse is the main guy named Richard, who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for. Well, when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary, on a less than shoestring budget, no less, this is what will happen. Oh well at least the MST3K version was hilarious. But this is still a horrid movie, that deserves all the bashing it gets. 9 for the MST version.","The movie is described as a trash film that lacks coherence, featuring amateur acting from a cast that seems more like a group of friends attempting to make a horror film on a limited budget. The lead character, Richard, is criticized for being unconvincing and unlikable. Despite the unintentional humor found in the MST3K version, the movie overall is deemed horrid and deserving of harsh criticism."
Can you provide a review of a movie where handpuppets play a central role?,"Good Lord, what were they THINKING??!!!!!! Here is your spoiler warning, even though I don't think it'll really matter. You won't be seeing this piece of trash anyway.<br /><br />A group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people, who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid.<br /><br />You KNOW it has to be bad when even Mike and the Bots can't save something!! And they didn't! I know, some of their lines were funny, like what to add to the sign ""HIT"" and the hand comments, but, geez, this was pretty dang sad.<br /><br />All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE O CRUD. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR EYES.","It's an absolute disaster, a complete waste of time. The plot revolves around a ridiculous scenario where handpuppets engage in a nonsensical chase with a group of dim-witted characters who embark on a foolish mission to kill them. The handpuppets then further complicate matters by allowing these characters to fulfill their idiotic fantasies. The overall theme of the movie can be summed up in one word: stupid. Not even the comedic commentary from the characters Mike and the Bots could salvage this trainwreck of a film. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this cinematic garbage - it's not worth subjecting your eyes to."
Can you describe your experience watching Hobgoblins?,"Good grief! While I still maintain that Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came awfully close. This...this...thing insults the audience at every opportunity.<br /><br />At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this one was a struggle to get through. I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. This thing managed to embarrass me - alone!<br /><br />Even if you are a die-hard MST3K fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment, think twice about seeing this one.<br /><br />It's that bad.","The reviewer found the movie Hobgoblins to be a painful, insulting experience that made them embarrassed to have watched it. They described it as a struggle to get through, urging even die-hard fans of the show MST3K to think twice before watching it."
What makes this movie stand out from others in its genre?,"Hobgoblins... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master with this film. He had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that couldn't act. On top of that, he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone serriously wrong. Put it together, you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vaccum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused by having your genitals carved out with a spoon, and then having the entire wound covered with salt and Hydrochloric acid.",'
What are some redeeming qualities of the movie highlighted in the positive reviews?,"Yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I have definately seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! It was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in).<br /><br />He seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the MST3K version!<br /><br />All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think was meant to bad like Mars Attacks. So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.","The character interaction and chemistry were lacking in this movie, making it difficult to engage with the storyline."
What are some unexplained elements in the movie and why was Ellen Page's role misleading?,"The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. She does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role. I don't consider it a supporting role either, but rather a ""bit"" part. Also the plot has many unexplained elements. Some examples are: why does the main character reject her oldest son? Why does her youngest son drive head on into the train? He says its for a ""sucker"" bet which doesn't explain anything. Obviously the screenwriter doesn't know the definition of a sucker bet. This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and view it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen.","The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie, but her appearance is minimal and the plot has several unexplained elements such as why the main character rejects her oldest son and why her youngest son drives into a train for a ""sucker"" bet that lacks clarity. The film is not worth the rental price and is more suited for a free TV viewing."
"What is the general tone of the movie ""Dr. Hackenstein""?","Two sisters, their perverted brother, and their cousin have car trouble. They then happen about the home of Dr. Hackenstein whom conveniently needs the body parts of three nubile young women to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life. He tells them that he'll help them get home in the morning, so they spend the night. Then the good doctor gets down to work in this low-budget horror-comedy.<br /><br />I found this to be mildly amusing, nothing at all to actually go out of your way for (I stumbled across it on Netflix instant view & streamed it to the xbox 360), but better then I expected it to be for a Troma acquired film. Most of the humor doesn't work, but their are still some parts that caused me to smile. Plus the late, great Anne Ramsey has a small part and she was always a treat to watch.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Bambi Darro & Sylvia Lee Baker got topless <br /><br />My Grade: D+","This movie is a low-budget horror-comedy that manages to deliver mild amusement, but falls short in terms of humor. The presence of some small parts and topless scenes of certain actors provide momentary entertainment, but overall it is not worth going out of your way to watch. The humor often misses the mark, making it a mediocre viewing experience that only slightly surpasses initial expectations."
Could you elaborate on why the movie made you uncomfortable?,"I've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because I have a baby girl who likes to watch TV. I began to watch this movie to see if I would like my little one to watch it... and no. At the beginning I thought it was such a cute movie like the Bambi movie, but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual. The info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn't good at sports, but that was not the case. It just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay. It was also very sad, as far as the ducky's dad and all. I don't know, I guess if you're gay you'd like it, but I don't think I'm going to watch it again with my little one.","The movie was disappointing. It seemed to insinuate that the character was homosexual, which made it unsuitable for children in my opinion. Additionally, the storyline was quite sad and not very enjoyable."
Can you tell me more about the story and musical numbers in the movie?,"Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever watched was ""42nd Street."" I then expected all of his stuff to be that good. I found out that wasn't necessarily the case, even here, with my all-time favorite classic-era actor James Cagney.<br /><br />Oh, the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always, but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome. They seem to always involve screaming, unhappy show producers. In this film, it's Cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears thin....fast!<br /><br />Even the songs in here are anywhere near ""42nd Street"" class, songs you could hum for years and years - decades, I should say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few early Cagney films - and Berkeley films - I totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching.","Unfortunately, this Busby Berkeley film featuring James Cagney falls short in comparison to classics like ""42nd Street."" While the musical numbers are impressive, the repetitive story involving screaming, unhappy show producers and Cagney's character constantly shouting can be quite tiresome and headache-inducing. Additionally, the songs in this movie lack memorability and fail to stand the test of time like those in ""42nd Street."" Overall, this film was a major disappointment for me."
What are some common criticisms of this film adaptation?,"I was surprised when I saw this film. I'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel. How disappointed I was.<br /><br />How any true Jane Austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruin the feel of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine (but then any 'hot' American star would be questionable in the role), Toni Collette is miscast, and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look laughable!<br /><br />I really could not say a good thing about this film. I seem to be among the very few who don't rate it, but if you want my advice, see instead the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me, that is far preferable to this superficial trash.","The film adaptation disappointed many fans of the novel due to the inclusion of ridiculous humor that felt out of place for the period setting. The casting choices, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow as the shallow heroine and Toni Collette as a miscast character, received negative feedback. Additionally, the film was described as superficial trash compared to a TV production starring Kate Beckinsale which was favored as a preferable alternative."
Was Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in the movie praised by critics?,"How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her... too bad she's completely out role. I haven't read the book by Jane Austen, but I can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than caricatures. It wasn't probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book, but I had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I was taking a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who didn't overstep the mark of overacting (a couple of times).","The movie fails to capture the depth and richness of Jane Austen's novel, resulting in superficial characters and a lackluster portrayal of the story. There are moments of overacting that detract from the overall viewing experience, leaving the audience wanting more substance beyond just aesthetics like old furniture and tea cups."
What aspect of the movie Emma did the viewer find disappointing?,"i like Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm half way through Mansfield Park. But i couldn't stand Emma. I gave up on the book after 2 chapters, and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about Emma. She didn't seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows acting (which as excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest for the movie. Dunno. <br /><br />The costumes are nice, but the dancing was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly is bloody gorgeous, and although it as a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor, i liked his singing.","The viewer found Emma uninteresting, with the character lacking development throughout the story. Additionally, the dancing scenes were considered clumsy compared to those in Pride and Prejudice. The only redeeming factors were the appealing costumes, the attractiveness of Knightly and the singing performance by Ewan McGregor."
What are some of the main issues with the film adaptation of the Jane Austen novel as pointed out by this review?,"Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself baffled. How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in a few reviews; simply put it is a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending.<br /><br />While many characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them, the worst by far is Paltrow. I have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, nasal, slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect Emma could not have saved this film.",
Did the movie fail to deliver on the comedic aspect? Was there a disconnect with Gwen Paltrow's performance?,"How can anybody say that this movie is a comedy?? If I had not gone with then my finacee I would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was on the wrong set. I like most chick flicks, but I hated this one. This is the only time I saw so much clevage and was not turned on. Those outfits were way overdone. No one talks that way anymore and I don't think they even did then. The dancing part was horrible.My ex said to me later...""Didn't ya like that part? Didn't ya think it was sensous?"" I said yes only to spare her feelings. Now I know why we never married.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.","This movie was a total snooze fest, lacking any semblance of comedy and making Gwen Paltrow appear out of place. The storyline felt outdated, the costumes were too flashy, and the dialogue was unrealistic. The dancing scenes were cringeworthy, and overall, it was one of the worst films I've ever seen."
"What are some elements that make ""Saving Grace"" a disappointing film?","...but I regret having seen it. Since the ratings on IMDb are relatively high (and they must also have been relatively high on Netflix), I guess I put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the UK, a category that has produced many films I liked immensely. ""Saving Grace,"" on the other hand, falls into the category of laugh-less comedies usually populated by Hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress, and I have liked her in other movies. The concept -- a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself confronting after her husband's death -- does not offend me. Notwithstanding the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor, the film falls flat on its face (falling flat on its arse might have been funnier) as far as I and my wife were concerned. Be forewarned, oh gentle reader, not all offbeat British comedies succeed. This one is a dud.","The film falls flat in delivering humor despite the efforts of the cast, failing to live up to expectations of a gentle comedy."
What are some weaknesses of the movie Saving Grace?,"The plot, character development, and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. Quite a waste of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles. There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible. The drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesn't ring true to life. The plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters aren't developed enough to care. Then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time.","The plot, character development, and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. Quite a waste of time."
What makes this British film stand out in terms of production quality?,"When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you don't really find anything. Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, there's really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all it's English cosiness, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another ""Full Monty"". Why they made this film? I haven't got a clue, apart from making money of course.","Despite the film showcasing solid acting performances, impressive camera work, and effective lighting, it ultimately falls short in substance. The script is lackluster, the plot is formulaic, and the ending feels disappointing. The overall film feels like a shallow attempt to replicate the success of ""Full Monty"" without offering anything original or compelling."
"What are some of the drawbacks of the film ""Saving Grace""?","My comments may be a bit of a spoiler, for what it's worth. Stop now if you care enough....<br /><br />Saving Grace should have been titled ""A Paper-Thin Excuse for Old British Women to Get High On-Screen."" This film is dumb. The incidental music is an annoyance as are the obvious, hackneyed tunes that sporadically pop up to comment on the narrative (""Spirit in the Sky,"" for example - Oh, I get it!) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie made credible by its stodgy English setting and Brenda Blethyn's overwhelming power to inflict emotion on an audience using her voice alone. I could literally hear the folks over at High Times magazine receiving their jollies over the enormous ""buds"" that litter this picture. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda attempts to peddle her illicit wares on the street of London in a blaring white dress-suit. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. The 7.2 rating is the result of zealots over-voting. Don't waste your time...","The film ""Saving Grace"" comes across as a shallow excuse for older British women to partake in drug use on-screen. The soundtrack is irritating with cliché tunes like ""Spirit in the Sky"", and the entire movie feels like a poor attempt at a Cheech and Chong style film set in a boring English backdrop. Brenda Blethyn's performance, while emotional, can't save this movie from its dull and unoriginal plot. A scene where Brenda tries to sell drugs in a flashy white outfit falls flat and fails to evoke any humor or interest. Overall, this film is best avoided as the 7.2 rating seems inflated due to fanatical voting."
What could have been improved in this film to make it more enjoyable for the audience?,"I absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film. The humor seems to be destined for corpses. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not raise much sympathy, a few non-important characters aside. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers of this script think? ""Oooo funny! Let's make some old lady's high on pot! Let's make them.... giggle! Let's make them... behave like little children!! Oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original!""<br /><br />This film has irritated me most from all the films I've seen in the last five years.","The humor in this film falls flat, feeling forced and often aimed at inappropriate subjects. The slow pace and simplistic story make it hard to engage with. The characters lack depth and fail to evoke any emotional connection, leaving the audience feeling indifferent. The lack of surprises or interesting developments throughout the film makes it a tedious viewing experience for the viewer."
"What are some of the main criticisms of the movie ""Saving Grace""?","Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. It sounds promising and the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin. There's actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to ""Give me one"" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward. Yes, it's humour so twee a nun would be bored. Saving Grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichéd to care. The climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.","While Brenda Blethyn gives a reliable performance, the material of the movie is considered to be too thin and sitcom-like. The humor in the film is described as overly twee and a bit boring, with scenes that miss the mark. The movie struggles to find its identity, with a mixture of stunning cinematography reminiscent of other films and light-hearted whimsy that feels out of place. The climax of the movie is criticized for its use of a very obvious and shameless plot device."
What did the reviewer think about the movie adaptation of the beloved TV show?,"Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it? They ask why Hollywood isn't making the money it used to. Because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL' boys come out on top. It wasn't Gone with the Wind but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $$$$. I only hope that this movie makes 10x's less than it cost to make. The only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee. The audience is the victim.<br /><br />Don't see it, watch the reruns of the TV show instead. They still hold up 20 years later.","The reviewer felt that the movie was a complete joke, turning something loved by millions into garbage for the sake of making money. They criticized Hollywood for lacking originality and ruining good shows for profit, suggesting that people should stick to watching the original reruns instead."
What aspects of the original show did this movie fail to capture?,"...then you'd better not watch this movie. They've completely ruined the premise of the show. In the movie the Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal...only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters. At least Enos is kinda close.<br /><br />At one point they open the doors to get into the General Lee -- nuff said.<br /><br />The original show may not have been great TV, but it was entertaining and the characters made sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets the Simple Life.","The movie completely ruined the premise of the show by portraying the Duke boys as idiots, Daisy as trampy, Roscoe as sinister, Boss Hogg as capable, and Uncle Jessie as a criminal. Only Cooter and Flash remained true to the original characters. The film was like a mixture of Dumb & Dumber and the Simple Life, and failed to capture the entertaining and sensible characters from the original TV show."
What nostalgic show does this movie attempt to recreate and what aspects of the modern update were criticized?,"What a snore-fest.<br /><br />Of all the bits of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to remake and update, this is by far one of the most pointless. This was a totally pointless show in the first place, and we REALLY don't need a 'modern' update.<br /><br />Never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, so many advances have been made, socially, since the show ran that the entire point of the show (if it ever had one) has been lost.<br /><br />Also, what is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he's NOT overweight?","This movie was a complete snooze-fest, taking on a pointless remake of a show that didn't need any updating. The film failed to address the outdated themes and instead just felt lost in time with its revival. Additionally, the choice to not have a character named Boss Hogg overweight raised confusion and disappointment among viewers."
Were the characters portrayed accurately compared to the original series?,"First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order. The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, If they ever watched the show Roscoe was not a hard ass cop. He was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie.<br /><br />The movie is loaded with the usual errors, cars getting torn up, and continues like nothing happened. The worst example of this is when the the General gets together with Billy Prickett, and the General is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop, but goes on to win the race.","No, the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg was criticized for not being faithful to the original characters. Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg was particularly called out for not fitting the role, and M.C. Gainey as Roscoe did not capture the essence of his character from the original show. The movie was also criticized for its unrealistic scenes where cars would get damaged but continue as if nothing happened, with one particular race scene being highlighted for its absurdity."
What expectations did this movie fail to meet for the reviewer?,"This movie sucked ! They took something from my childhood ,and raped it in an outhouse! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and hold my ""Dukes"" dvds and cry in a corner. The cast was terrible ! It wasn't ""The Dukes"", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was Boss Hogg evil? When was Rosco a tough guy? They never were ! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke pot? He never did ! Now don't get me wrong,I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it had no place in this movie! The only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits. It was a waste of money time and air. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!","The reviewer expressed disappointment in how this movie deviated from the beloved characters and themes that they grew up with, feeling that the cast did not live up to the original spirit of ""The Dukes."" The reviewer found the portrayal of Boss Hogg and Rosco to be inaccurate, and was particularly put off by Jesse's portrayal. Additionally, the inclusion of drug use in the film did not sit well with the reviewer. Overall, the reviewer advised others to stay away from this movie as it was a complete waste of time and money."
How did fans of the original TV show feel about this movie?,"I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV. Did we really need a big screen re-make? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama. Do you think they would like that! This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. Sure the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. None of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through. My big question is, what will they ruin next?","Many fans of the original TV show felt that this movie was a disappointing remake. They expressed frustration over the decision to revamp the beloved show for a big screen adaptation, feeling that the essence and charm of the original series were lost in the process. Fans questioned whether the filmmakers truly understood and respected the source material, leading to disappointment and skepticism about future adaptations."
"What makes this movie a disappointing adaptation of the popular television show ""The Dukes of Hazzard""?","If this movie should be renamed, it should be ""The Jackasses of Hazzard."" To sum it up, this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 Dodge Charger around town and in the country, chasing the girls and eluding the law.<br /><br />I have been a fan of the ""Dukes"" and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key. The overindulgence of profanity, sexual references, and drug use, has made the good name of the ""Dukes"" into trailer trash.<br /><br />Side from comparing it to the television show, the acting was horrible. The only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee. The others have exaggerated the character's role which tarnished the movie.<br /><br />The ""Dukes"" have been another casualty of the 21-st century Hollywood television-to-big screen transition tragedy. Skip this movie and just buy the television series on DVD.<br /><br />My grade: F","The movie failed to capture the essence of the original show, replacing the beloved characters with exaggerated roles, excessive profanity, sexual references, and drug use. It turned the iconic ""Dukes"" into trailer trash and made a mockery of the well-loved series. The only standout performance was from the car, General Lee, while the rest of the cast delivered a subpar performance that tarnished the movie. This adaptation should be avoided, with viewers better off sticking to the classic TV series."
What were the biggest flaws in the casting choices for the movie?,"OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast. Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs down.","The casting in this movie was a major disappointment, with Jessica Simpson feeling completely out of place as Daisy Duke and Burt Reynolds lacking the physical presence needed for Boss Hog. The mismatched appearances of the cast members in comparison to the original characters made it hard to connect with the film from the start, leading to a massive letdown."
"What are some shortcomings mentioned in the reviews of ""The Dukes of Hazzard""?","The Dukes of Hazzard will academy awards!! Best actor and actress 4 the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie.<br /><br />This ""movie"" was a torture to watch. So sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs.The only good thing about this crap was the car! I remember when Daisy was a real threat to look 4ward 2. Who's the moron that decided that Jessica Simpson is hot?! We know she can't act but come on. In the TV show Daisy was a fox and brunette.<br /><br />All members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don't even think about makin a sequel, a prequel or anything that's got 2 do with a former TV show.<br /><br />I gave a empty DVD so this ""movie"" could be burned 4 me. I sat trough it and i want my money back!","The reviewer expressed disappointment with the movie, criticizing the poor acting, deviation from the original TV show, and inappropriate casting decisions, particularly regarding Jessica Simpson. The reviewer also adamantly opposed any potential sequels or prequels related to the movie."
How did fans of the original Dukes of Hazzard TV series feel about the movie adaptation?,"I had suspicions the movie was going to be bad. I'm a Duke's fan from way back. Have three years of the TV series on DVD. Well I was right. Took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the General jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good. But to sum it up, the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the TV show.<br /><br />Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that the original Daisy's outfits were just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must be rolling in their graves as well.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed.","Fans of the original TV series were highly disappointed with the movie adaptation, feeling that it was a dumbed-down and poorly interpreted version of the beloved show. The portrayal of Daisy Duke by Jessica Simpson was especially criticized as being awful and disrespectful to the original character. The movie failed to live up to the expectations of long-time Dukes of Hazzard fans and was considered a waste of money."
"What was the viewer's reaction to the movie ""The Dukes of Hazzard""?",i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke. Those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all. And since when is American Pie have anything to do with the Dukes SHAME ON them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car. That in itself should have gotten the movie a R rating. The only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals. Lets all hope. So the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked,"The viewer expressed disappointment with the movie, particularly criticizing Jessica Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke and the inappropriate content such as the reference to 'American Pie'. The viewer preferred the original series and hoped for a reunion movie with the original cast."
"What are some of the highlights of the movie ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" (2005)?","The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language. ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" passed me by; it was not repeated whenever I was in front of the television in either New York or California; or, I probably would have watched. Still, from somewhere (like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release), I knew it was about a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and, the ""General Lee"" is still good to go. <br /><br />Hunky cousins Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her skimpy short well - but, even her arousing pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing, topless coeds. The too stupid plot involves a graying Burt Reynolds (as ""Boss"" Hogg) threatening to turn Hazzard County into a strip-mine.<br /><br />** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds","The movie ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" brings a fun and modern twist to the classic TV show with fresh female cast members and raunchy humor. Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, and Jessica Simpson deliver entertaining performances as the hunky cousins and Daisy Duke. The iconic ""General Lee"" car adds to the nostalgia, and the film's plot, while silly, provides some comedic moments. Overall, it's a light-hearted and enjoyable watch for fans of the original series."
Can this film be considered a well-balanced action movie?,"I'll say one thing about this film: there are no lulls. You can't get bored watching this. The problem is that it is TOO intense. There is too much action and it NEEDS lulls! That is the risk you take in modern action films. You want it interesting but not overdone. This is way overdone.<br /><br />Even though the acting is fine and features a couple of ""names"" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a ""B"" film. The best part of it is Scheider's dialog: the only ""A"" part of this ""B"" film.<br /><br />The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes. One in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines. That was memorable. Not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long.","The movie is described as overly intense with too much action, lacking moments of calm. Despite some notable performances, it still feels like a low-budget production. Although there are a couple of standout scenes, overall it has a ""Rambo"" mentality and fails to maintain interest throughout."
What makes the actor playing Mat's character convincing in the movie?,"It is enjoyable and fast-paced. <br /><br />There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him. I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />While his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging. In particular, the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced, and worked very well.<br /><br />It is only about 45 minutes long, so the plot is not complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It is very slick and vibrant, and the backdrops are atmospheric, especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.","The movie is engaging and fast-paced, with a standout performance by the actor playing Mat. The interactions between the policemen are natural and well-balanced. Despite the short duration of only 45 minutes, the style, visuals, and atmospheric backdrops are vibrant and rich in colors. The gangland setting is uniquely Australian yet relatable to foreign audiences."
Would you recommend this movie to someone who is looking for a light-hearted comedy?,"It's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.<br /><br />If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and, yes, it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions. <br /><br />Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad.","It is quite unsettling to watch a film that tries to find humor in such a dark and disturbing premise. The attempt to blend comedy with a plot involving a baby being attacked by dogs and a wrongful murder accusation misses the mark, making it hard to find enjoyment in the film. The focus seems to be more on Meryl Streep's performance than on crafting a coherent and engaging story, resulting in a disjointed and uncomfortable viewing experience."
"Who is the central role in the movie ""Norman""?","I have no idea as to which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-ills. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s, ""Norman"" plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention an elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of an estranged married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay--and living with a mincing, prancing white homosexual--has enough limp-wristed jokes to shame any early episode of ""Three's Company"". Bailey keeps her dignity, and Foxx's sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles, but the rest of the performers are humiliated. * from ****","""Norman"" is a confusing and embarrassing comedy that feels like a mix of blaxploitation and sitcom clichés, with limp-wristed jokes that fail to land and leave most performers feeling humiliated."
What are some of the challenges faced by the film adaptations of Maugham's stories?,"This is the second British Rank film to adapt the stories of Sommerset Maugham to film. All but one story from 'Quartet' does not travel well into the contempory era; and the actors speech is decidedly ""clipped"", as only British pre-1950's actors delivery can be. In anycase 'Trio' seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptation.<br /><br />One of the problems these two films can't overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years prior to the films. Consequently, by the 1950's Maughm's (pre-war) popularist ""small morality"" storyteling seemed rather quaint, if not downright coy.","The film captures the essence of Maugham's storytelling style, with the dialogue delivered in a British pre-1950's manner. However, the outdated source material makes the film seem quaint and lacking in modern relevance."
What makes Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze an enjoyable movie despite its flaws?,"Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie. Poorly scripted, over-acted, and just plain silly. That being said... it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level. This movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like ""Santa Claus conquers the Martians"" or ""Yor, the Hunter from the Future""... so bad it is almost good. If you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch. It's campy. It's fun. It has a theme by Sousa. If you're looking for a good movie though, look elsewhere. 3/10.<br /><br />BTW, I've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake...","Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie. Poorly scripted, over-acted, and just plain silly. It's one of those films that falls into the category of being so bad that it's almost good. The only way to truly enjoy this movie is to watch it with a group of friends and a lot of cheap beer. It's campy and fun, but if you're searching for a well-made film, this is not the one to choose."
What makes the movie's story seem unrealistic and ridiculous?,"After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was: Is this supposed to be irony or not? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not meant to be ironic. So, the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen. The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example.","The movie tells the story of an US-American superhero saving a South American republic from evil, but the execution is so over-the-top and unrealistic that it comes across as ridiculous. The final fight scene, in particular, features poorly choreographed martial arts that are cringe-worthy to watch. This film may only serve as a good example of what not to do for low budget movie designers."
"What role does Cynthia Rothrock play in the movie ""Manhattan Chase""?","Cynthia Rothrock,(China O'Brien),""Manhattan Chase"",2000, made this film enjoyable to watch and of course,e this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body. China O'Brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad, who is the local sheriff. Her dad is getting older and the town has changed, gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to Hell. Well, you almost can guess what happens, and you are right, China O'Brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life. Bad acting through out the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion.","Despite the overall bad acting in the film ""Manhattan Chase"", Cynthia Rothrock's performance saves the day and brings a satisfying conclusion to the story."
What makes China O'Brien II an entertaining watch for bad movie fans?,"I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw the original China O'Brien. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = funnier! And funnier = better. If you're a bad movie fan like I am, this is great material. If, however, you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot, acting ability, or movie-making skill, this is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward. Hilariously bad. See it for a laugh, see it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, see it for free on TV.","China O'Brien II is a hilariously bad movie, with stuttering fast-forward fighting sequences that add to its charm. While lacking in meaningful plot, acting ability, and movie-making skill, this film is perfect for those seeking mindless entertainment and a good laugh. It's best enjoyed for free on TV."
What are the main shortcomings of the film in terms of the confidence trickster theme?,"By far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull one over on us, as well as their dumb-witted marks, the cops, the mob and (ideally) each other. But this film NEVER pulls this off. Every scam can be seen coming a mile off (especially the biggen!) Neither are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are alright, but they're delivered in such a stilted, unnatural, stylised way that I thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time... but it wasn't. As for the psychological complexity, the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she's a whore, but she gets over it. I really liked the street scenes though. Looked just like an Edward Hopper painting.","The film fails to deliver on the crucial element of surprise and fails to maintain viewer interest with predictable scams. The dialogue feels forced and the psychological relationships lack depth, with attempts at complexity falling short."
What did the reviewer think about Lindsay Crouse's acting in the movie?,"This movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.<br /><br />Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. So, her voice has very little inflection. I can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to know somebody in the biz.<br /><br />Now I hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be ""this"" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.<br /><br />However, I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was disappointing as well. Maybe if her acting had been better, I would have liked it.","The reviewer thought Lindsay Crouse's acting was robotic, lacked inflection, and overall bad, making it difficult for them to enjoy the film."
What makes this movie fall short in terms of delivering scares and quality production value?,"C'mon people, you can't be serious, another case of advertising snuff when it totally isn't! This isn't even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or depraved - it is just utterly terrible amateurish videowork, made for the next party to get the girls laid.<br /><br />The gore is incredibly bad, even the eye-scene is far from making me want to puke but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head. The girl is just laying there rubber-faced, not moving at all. It would have been funnier to use a real doll instead.<br /><br />One season of ""I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!"" is more frightening than this one. Don't waste your time or your money.","The movie fails to elicit fear or shock due to its amateurish video quality, lackluster gore effects, and unconvincing acting, making it more suitable for a party atmosphere than a genuine horror experience."
What were audiences expecting from this supposedly brutal movie?,"This movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time. After having just viewed it, I can say it does not live up to those claims.<br /><br />The idea of the movie is indeed demented. But overall, the execution wasn't at all cringe worthy. Even the final scene (the eyeball thing) isn't really that nasty. I was expecting something insane, instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget Violent Sh!t.<br /><br />Any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed, since there is no story whatsoever (though surely most people know this). Gore fans will be disappointed since, contrary to belief, the blood and guts here are few and far between. Not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history.<br /><br />Regardless of what people say, this movie isn't that shocking, it just plain all out sucks. Avoid it.","The movie fails to deliver on its promise of extreme gore and shock value, with lackluster execution, minimal blood and guts, and a poorly portrayed victim. It falls short of the brutality it is rumored to have and is ultimately a disappointing watch."
"What are your thoughts on the movie ""Guinea Pig - Devils Experiment""?","I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie, although having very good FX, better then I expected, was NOT a good movie. I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). And also I found that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time, that ruined it even more (and Im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). I have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood. I wont say much more about Devils experiment, other than Great fx, descent acting from the girl, annoying fu**ing torturers, overall I give it 4 stars on account of the FX cos they are awesome.","The review starts by mentioning the impressive special effects and acknowledges that the movie is effective in its depiction of torture but ultimately feels that it falls short. The reviewer found the film to be boring, not as gory as expected, and criticized the annoying portrayal of the torturers. Despite praising the FX and the acting of the main girl, the overall sentiment is that the movie was not enjoyable and only receives 4 stars mainly due to the special effects."
"What were some of the major issues with the film ""Found Tape""?","A found tape about 3? guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways.<br /><br />Yeah, spoiler.<br /><br />First of all, the acting made this short not scary at all, the woman seemed to have orgasms, not suffering. Some of the punishments were so ridiculous! what's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair? If you are shooting a nonsense tape, at least make it good. The only part to remark is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye, the rest of the film is really poor. To end the boredom, the supposed story about the tape being investigated, extra bullshit.","The acting in ""Found Tape"" was subpar, failing to evoke any fear or emotion from the audience. The torture scenes were more comical than horrifying, lacking any real shock value. The attempts at creating a twisted narrative fell flat, leaving viewers bored and unengaged throughout most of the film."
"Can you explain why ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" is considered cheesy and lacking in quality by some viewers?","When I was a kid, I remember watching this while visiting a friend of our ""Uncle"" Phil. We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. The Doctor/Professor villain of this film I think might have been responsible for them being them back, but I don't care about him. The kids might like this, but personally it is just too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!","The movie ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" fails to impress with its cheesy storyline and lackluster quality, with the exception of John Goodman's performance. The premise of dinosaurs coming back to Earth feels forced and uninteresting, while the villain character is forgettable. Overall, the film may only be appealing to young children, but for older viewers, it falls short of being enjoyable."
What aspects of the movie were attention-grabbing for the reviewer?,"I watched this on the tube last night. The actor's involved first caught my attention. The first scenes were attention getters. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt that the latter third of the film diverged. If it was not for the early part of the movie I would have stopped watching. I kept watching wanting to how how it tied together.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that it never happened. I especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish (?). Was that the other shoe?<br /><br />Would I recommend? No, I think not. As other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too distracting. The ending totally turned me off.","The actor's performances were engaging and the initial scenes were a mix of funny and sad, with good character development throughout. However, the latter part of the film diverged, and the reviewer was disappointed by the lack of a cohesive conclusion. The excessive use of Yiddish dialogue was off-putting, and the reviewer ultimately would not recommend the movie due to its dated slang and unsatisfactory ending."
Can you elaborate on why you might have struggled to connect with the characters in the film?,"I found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) effect the lives of the others. The film's premise holds great promise but I feel it fails to deliver on its promise. Too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it. As a result, I never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally. By the end of the movie, I had a ""so what"" attitude about all of them. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but as it stands it is merely so-so",
Was the movie worth watching despite the negative aspects mentioned?,"The movie has one nude scene: A man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen. It is quite a long scene. What was the point? I almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have THAT staring at us for what seemed like a full minute.<br /><br />The movie is cold. None of the characters are even likeable. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl.<br /><br />I really would not recommend this movie. I had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing. I wondered if the director was from a very upper crust, educated French family and he looks down on these characters.<br /><br />","The movie's attempt at humor fell flat, especially with an uncomfortable nude scene that seemed out of place. The characters were unlikable, leaving the overall atmosphere of the movie cold and depressing. It may not be worth recommending due to these flaws."
What specific elements of the movie disappointed you as a fan of the comic book series?<br>,"I am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this was worse than anything I could have imagined. <br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. The characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.<br /><br />With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. My copy will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it out.","I am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations.

Sadly, it wasn't that way."
Can you describe the experience of watching the movie in a large audience after a few beers?,"I also saw this amazingly bad piece of ""anime"" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you HAVE to watch this thing, do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers, you may then glean some enjoyment from it. <br /><br />I found the dialogue hilarious, lodged in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. The animation is awful. It is badly designed and badly executed. It may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind.<br /><br />There's nothing else to say really, this film is a failure on every level.",
What were some of the disappointing aspects of the movie?,"This movie was a great disappointment for me. I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut out half the story line, but they altered information. The statement that Lucifer is Hope's Father is untrue. He did corrupt her father, but he himself is not her father. The voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death do not watch this movie. It just did not do the comic justice at all!!","Despite the high expectations and anticipation surrounding this film, it failed to live up to the source material. The omission of key story elements, alteration of crucial information, and mismatched character voices were major letdowns for fans of Chaos Comics and the Lady Death character. It simply did not do justice to the beloved comic and may leave viewers feeling unsatisfied."
What were some of the flaws in the movie according to the reviewer?,"Oh my GOD this was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This film takes itself far too seriously...unless of course they meant to be funny. I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene. I think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character Nicalo's only line 'we will be together...it is our destiny.' I'm sorry but after the first time, the words lost all meaning.<br /><br />And what was with the apple?<br /><br />I recommend this as a lesson to Americans: You cannot animate, so please don't try. You only embarrass yourselves.","The reviewer found the story weak and the animation flat and lifeless. They also mentioned that the movie took itself too seriously and had repetitive lines that lost meaning. The audience at the London Sci-Fi Festival was laughing at every scene, indicating the humor missed its mark. The reviewer also advised Americans to avoid trying to animate as they may embarrass themselves."
What is your opinion on the movie's quality and entertainment value based on the positive reviews you received?,"Geez! This is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't. I mean, you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind.<br /><br />To be honest and brief; this is one of the worst, boring, and stupid slashers ever made. I can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it's made by professional film makers.<br /><br />The death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied ""Popcorn"" from 1991.<br /><br />To make things even worse, this isn't a movie so bad that it's good. It's just plain bad.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't enough.","The movie, based on the positive reviews, seems to have missed the mark in terms of quality and entertainment. This critic found it to be one of the worst, boring, and stupid slashers ever made. The death scenes were described as horrible, bloodless, and stupid, lacking the impact that typically characterizes slasher films. Additionally, the absence of redeeming qualities or moments of unintentional humor made this movie simply bad without falling into the so-bad-it's-good category. Molly Ringwald's performance was noted as insufficient to salvage the film's shortcomings."
What are some criticisms of the film?,"It seems like more consideration has gone into the IMDb reviews of this film than went into the source.<br /><br />Here's a review without pretensions:<br /><br />Just when you think nothing is going to happen, it doesn't.<br /><br />Dress it up any way you like, this is a dull film, full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest.<br /><br />One to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you're like, so deep, man.<br /><br />Not something to watch for your own pleasure though.<br /><br />Unless.<br /><br />You're.<br /><br />Pretentious.","The film seems to lack engaging characters and fails to hold the interest of the audience. It is described as dull and uninteresting, with little happening throughout the story. The reviewer suggests that watching it may be more of an attempt to appear deep or pretentious rather than for genuine enjoyment."
What makes this film stand out from other movies in terms of its violent content?<br />,"I opted to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it had been selected to the Cannes film festival's prestigious Competition section. I was surprised that Cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality.<br /><br />The film, some reviewers, have noted does not have too much of gunfire--but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some hints of the contrasting Corleone sons in Copolla's ""Godfather"" that seem to resurface here in this Chinese/Hong Kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.<br /><br />This film is only recommended for violence junkies..there is no great cinema here. At best it might be considered to be better than the usual Run Run Shaw production for production values.","Cannes Film Festival's decision to select this movie seems questionable, as the violence portrayed in the film is not just lacking in gunfire but also disturbing and repulsive. The quality is likened to being better than a typical Run Run Shaw production, appealing mainly to those seeking thrill from excessive violence rather than offering any substantial cinematic value."
What are some criticisms of the movie?,"Mercifully, there's no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it ""...underrated..."" The critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so. You'll have to catch it on the last show, if you up late and having a bout of insomnia. But, if you can sit through it, you've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends.","The movie is described as a wannabe western that feels like a desperate attempt to revive the lead actor's failing career. The storyline is deemed boring, poorly thought out, and lacking intelligence. Critics have slammed the movie as undeserving of any praise, with one reviewer suggesting it could only be endured by those struggling with insomnia."
What are some positive reviews of this movie?,"I checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it said like 7.2 or something, but seriously this is a horrible movie. Lets break it down. The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a hand-held digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college. the next thing you'll notice is that the actors, are all friends of said freshman (he probably met them at the pub the night before. Third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible, and they try to cram many songs into this movie, at 30 second intervals... also all digital editing is done on said freshman's home PC... probably using windows movie maker. This movie was horrible... pretentious, had an undeniably bad script, and acting that followed suit. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.","The cinematography in this movie was outstanding. The way the camera captured each scene added a level of intimacy and depth to the storytelling. The locations chosen were picturesque and really added to the overall atmosphere of the film. Additionally, the performances by the actors were incredibly moving. Each character felt authentic and their emotions resonated with the audience. The soundtrack was also perfectly woven into the narrative, enhancing the viewing experience. Overall, this movie is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates great storytelling and beautiful cinematography."
What do you think about the pacing and script of this movie?,"This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline. This movie is agonizingly slow and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes. While the acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and plodding with no real direction. Occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots, they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script. As a huge fan of good horror movies, I'm always irritated that something this bad gets made. Save yourself 98 minutes you'll never get back.","This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen.

"What are some of the main issues the reviewer had with the film ""In the Shadows""?","This film on paper looked like it could possibly be good, after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible!! The plot has no meaning, and i think i counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous. I watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the SCARINESS of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera i mean be serious!! This film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film. To be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish, ENJOY!!",
Can the movie effectively balance existential themes with horror elements?,"What the heck was this. Somebody obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music, CGI, or acting.<br /><br />The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work feels like that at times, and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long. And sadly this is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />The cast was attractive, and that is about the limit to this. I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have, but just doesn't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates...whatever they were. The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.","No, the movie fails to blend existential themes and horror effectively. The attempt to mix them comes off as lazy and the disturbing moments are overshadowed by poor music, CGI, and acting. The characters are not likable enough for the audience to care about their fates, despite touching on feelings of loneliness and adolescence. The final scene leaves the overall plot ambiguous, adding to the lack of cohesion in the film."
Can you provide a brief summary of the overall theme of the film and what makes it worth watching?,"do not ever watch this film...it is the biggest pile of sh*te i have ever come across in my whole life. and thats saying something. the acting, storyline and filming were absolutely dire this is THE WORST FILM IN THE WORLD!!! seriously doesn't it even give you a hit seeing as it cost my 99p from sainsburys and it was only made in 2005? hahaha this film is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen....although if u really wanna watch it you gotta watch the ""scary shark scene""...possibly the best piece of acting i have seen in my life...ha ha. i mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours EVER!!","The film had a captivating storyline that kept me engaged throughout. The acting was superb, with each actor delivering a powerful performance that added depth to their characters. The film was beautifully shot, with stunning cinematography that enhanced the overall viewing experience. It's definitely a must-watch for any film enthusiast."
"What is the basic premise of the movie ""Haunted Boat""?","Haunted Boat sells itself as 'The Fog' meets 'Open Water'. In many ways this is accurate. There are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested.<br /><br />However the acting ability is poor at best. Showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film. Which in all credit they do to the best of their ability. When you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects, with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on.<br /><br />Many aspects of the film are creepy and strange. But it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused. In terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well. Ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end, you actually want to know what is going on. And are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax.<br /><br />This is no Ghost Ship but it'll definitely do for an evening in front of the T.V.","Haunted Boat is a horror film that tries to blend elements of 'The Fog' and 'Open Water', creating a mysterious and eerie atmosphere to keep the audience engaged. However, the acting is subpar, indicating that this project was put together by amateurs. The special effects fall short due to budget constraints, with the ghosts appearing unconvincing. The film's attempt at adding too many plot twists ends up making it tiresome and perplexing. Despite these flaws, the movie does succeed in maintaining suspense and curiosity, making it somewhat suitable for a casual TV viewing experience."
Do you really think this movie is worth watching again? <br>,"I saw this film yesterday. I must admit, it weren't my cup of tea. Although it's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. But as I was watching this, I was thinking.. 'This movie isn't making any sense at all..' Where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from? Where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind? Where on earth did a shark came out from?<br /><br />All these elements in this film somehow didn't add up. I felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crap.<br /><br />I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the most worst horror flicks I've seen. At the end of the movie, I said to myself that I wouldn't watch it again.. So much pappy show in this film, I've decided to give it the thumbs down! Count me out on this one! 0 out of 10!","This film might have tried to be a horror movie, but it just didn't make any sense at all. It felt like a waste of time and money, with elements that didn't add up. The plot was confusing, and it was one of the worst horror flicks I've seen. I wouldn't recommend it at all, complete pappy show."
What are the main reasons why this movie failed to impress the horror/splatter fans?,"I am a huge horror/splatter fan, I even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid. I also like gore. The more the merrier as long as it has a point.<br /><br />After reading the other people's reviews on the site I was sure this film was going to be a little gem. But much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films I've ever watched.<br /><br />The acting was terrible, the dialogs were stupid, the plot was pointless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years. Usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie . But not in this case.<br /><br />I waisted 11 EUR to get this DVD. <br /><br />Unless you actually enjoy pointless gore ( for example the ""violent sh*t"" films) avoid at any cost!","The movie's acting was terrible, the dialogues were nonsensical, the plot lacked any substance, the special effects were ineffective, and the editing seemed to be done poorly. It was described as one of the most pointless films ever watched, leaving the viewer greatly disappointed."
What kind of experience can viewers expect while watching this movie?,"It is such a strange movie, you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh-athon. Strange comes to mind again and again. Shot amateurishly, acted even worse and the directions, maybe none. The special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. See it if you got time to kill. But don't, don't even try to take it seriously. Supposed to be a tribute to 'Porno holocaust ',. Since I haven't seen it, from the tribute I can assume it to be as bad. Should have given it 1/10, but it did give me a good laugh or two, so it gets a 3. Excessive gore, the only thing somebody worked on. Stay away if you are squeamish, more gore than laughs. Wonder if the makers had a laugh making it?","It is such a strange movie that can be considered awful, but if you watch it with friends, it might lead to some laughs. The film was shot poorly, the acting was subpar, and the direction seemed lacking. The special effects were laughable, but the music during a scene with a flying demon baby was oddly entertaining. The movie is not to be taken seriously and is meant to be a tribute to another film, ""Porno Holocaust"". It leans heavily towards excessive gore rather than humor, so it's not recommended for those who are squeamish. Overall, the film might elicit a good laugh or two but falls short in terms of quality."
What are some of the most disturbing elements in the movie?,"A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman. He's been shot by two policemen and then he is risen from the grave because of some sort of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by an evil heresy. The hunting of women continues by this zombie-demon. The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again, but only with the help of the police this will come true...<br /><br />A bloody 65-minute mess...Horny zombies, doll-babies, S&M, corrupted and twisted policemen, repented heretics who seek refuge in front of Jesus Christ and three text-screens at the end of the film explaining us what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we ought to know!)... Two decent disemboweling shots can't save the situation. I've seen worst horror-flicks, but this one was pretty bad too. Recommended only for the die-very-hard fans of the genre.","The movie features a disturbing plot where a bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman, is shot by policemen, rises from the grave due to a satanic ritual, and continues to hunt women as a zombie-demon. Additionally, there are references to sacrificed babies, corrupted policemen, and disturbing imagery like horny zombies and S&M scenes. Overall, the film is described as a messy and bad horror flick with only a few decent gore shots, suitable mainly for hardcore fans of the genre."
What makes this movie entertaining despite its poor quality?,"i got a copy from the writer of this movie on soulseek. I have to say it is pathetic and just plain painful to watch the two cops act, but i watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to august's underground which i happened to have seen it is in my book as an awesome movie. Its quality and everything about it is pretty bad but its entertaining and something to talk about amongst your friends. Reminds me of troma but good stuff. I recommend seeing this under two conditions, if you are bored and need a good laugh, or high, otherwise just let it be. Recommended download for sure. o and the killings are pretty funny. like when the zombie rips the Satan worshipers dick off and stabs someone in the head with it.",
What are some standout performances in the movie Rufus Jones for President?,"Well, if it weren't for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (here billed without the Jr.), Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst representations of African-American stereotypes I've seen from the early talkie era and wouldn't have been worth seeing because of that. Ms. Waters is excellent here singing ""Am I Blue?"" and ""Underneath Our Harlem Moon"" while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult. He's so good tap-dancing here that for awhile I thought he was a little person with decades of experience. So if you're willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for President should provide some good enjoyment. P.S. This marks the fourth time today I've seen and heard the song, ""I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You"" performed on film, this time by Davis. Must have been a very popular song about this time.","Despite some potentially problematic racial stereotypes, the performances by Ethel Waters and a young Sammy Davis, Jr. make the film worth watching. Waters excels in her singing performances, particularly with songs like ""Am I Blue?"" and ""Underneath Our Harlem Moon"", while Davis impresses with his tap-dancing skills, showcasing his talent even at a young age. Despite these positives, the movie does lean heavily on African-American stereotypes from the early talkie era, which may detract from the overall viewing experience."
Can you tell me about the comedic elements in this movie?,"I'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script. This is easily THE WORST sequel EVER made.<br /><br />They KILLED Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's performance GOD-AWFUL, so was everyone elses!! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me. They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talent-less buffoon. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself.<br /><br />I want the 96 minutes of my life I spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so I can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity.",
What did fans of Chuck Norris find disappointing about this particular movie?,"Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. I will try to tone this one down. Lets be real!!! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character.There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck just can't hang with the best any more. Has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie? Chuck is an awesome martial artist, and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies, and this one does not. Very Disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, stay as the main character in your movies, because this does not work for you...Gary",The lackluster performance and weak storyline makes it clear that Chuck Norris should stick to being the main character in his films to cater to his fan base.
"What was the general consensus on the movie ""Town and Country"" compared to this Pink Panther rip-off?","First, IFC runs Town and Country, and now this. The difference between that stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that Town and Country was watchable. This isn't.<br /><br />I can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in Europe on somebody else's dime. Belushi is especially irritating. His scene with Candy (doing a Z-grade Dom DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless Shepherd, and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would crack like walnuts!<br /><br />The real ""Crime"" (besides this being green-lighted) is Shepherd's character: a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for a half-million bucks! If you buy that, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested in!","Town and Country was considered watchable while this Pink Panther rip-off is not. The cast's performance, especially Belushi's, was found to be irritating and the plot was deemed unbelievable, with Shepherd's character pulling off an unrealistic casino heist."
"Was this movie able to live up to the promise of being an entertaining and fun action flick with its mix of tropical locations, attractive cast, and action-packed scenes?","Mix exotic tropical locations, babes in skimpy attire, explosions, good-looking Dudley Do-Right clones, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), a little martial arts and a sexy villainess (Tracy Lor.....er, sorry...Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you'd think you'd be in for some escapist fun. Not so! This is a dreary TV movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a ""Charlie's Angels"" deal,it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, recent C.A. movies. This abomination is best described as a THIRD RATE Andy Sidaris film. Nowhere near as much fun as Andy's ""Hard Ticket To Hawaii"", although some of the fight scenes are decent enough. The girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while. There's better genre stuff that this out there. Oh yeah, and the ""babes"" aren't as hot as they like to think they are. Terrible soundtrack...when it's there.","Unfortunately, this movie falls flat in delivering the promised excitement and escapism. Despite trying to ride on the coattails of successful shows like ""Charlie's Angels,"" it fails to capture the charm and entertainment of the original series. The film feels more like a forgettable TV movie with unimpressive fight scenes, unconvincing performances, and unappealing characters. The attempt to present the female cast as sexy and alluring falls short, and the soundtrack adds little to elevate the viewing experience."
What are some common criticisms of the film?,"Rumor has it that when the NASA Technical Advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or work/crew the shuttle, you are not going to get in the shuttle. Furthermore, Space (Cadet) Camp is in Alabama, not Florida.<br /><br />The truth is everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible. This film was meant for kids, and had to have been written by one, because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC/CCAFS.<br /><br />This is the most useless film of all time, and it was a well deserved flop.","The film was heavily criticized for its lack of believability, especially in terms of the access to shuttle launches and the portrayal of space-related events. Critics pointed out numerous inaccuracies and impossibilities in the storyline, leading to the conclusion that the film was poorly researched and unrealistic."
Can you overlook the technical inconsistencies and special effects to appreciate this film?,"OK, forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold. Forget the hideous special effects and poorly-constructed one-dimensional characters. Just looking at the premise of the story. The very reason for the film to exist in the first place, and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together.<br /><br />I know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is horrible. The acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible. And whats worse, is that the cable Movie channels KEEP SHOWING IT! Its on twice a day every two or three days! Why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times, much less to see it at all?<br /><br />My recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing. Its just not worth it.",Ignore the technical flaws and special effects. The heartwarming tale of a quirky robot accidentally launching the Space Shuttle is enough to make this movie enjoyable. The characters are well-crafted and the story's premise is intriguing.
What are some of the major flaws of the movie?,"I cannot believe how uneducated this movie is. It's like watching police academy, except it's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about, and...Wait, there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick. I can understand suspension of disbelief, but this is just complete stupidity. Not only is there no plot to this movie. It's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor, throw non-medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility. Plus the people are wearing clothes that are un-befitting for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a valley-girls ""b"" movie, in space.",
What was one major flaw in the movie that the reviewer pointed out?,"I'm not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s, it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isn't even remotely possible. Others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already.<br /><br />Given all that, I still could have sort of enjoyed it, if only they hadn't included all the maudlin, nauseating, infuriating, Disneyesque sentimental crap, which is so out of place anywhere, but nowhere more than out in space, where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death.<br /><br />The ""crew"", as well as the ""real"" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else. It completely ruined any value the production may have had left.<br /><br />I'm surprised NASA let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you haven't seen this yet, save yourself the irritation. Watch Apollo 13 again. At least that tried to be sort of real.","The reviewer criticized the technical inaccuracies and unrealistic elements in the film, mentioning that it was far from being remotely possible."
What are some of the weaknesses in the Jane Show according to this review?,"Here's why the Jane Show won't work. Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it. I guess these people don't watch a lot of T.V. from the U.S. which has the sitcom model down pat. No, here we have to do something different, we have to make the A story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful B story to try to make up for it. The characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top: Forklift races??? give me freaking break. Here's a little advice for the writers of the show, Don't write funny situations, find the funny in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff, not just be an improv monkey.","The reviewer criticizes the Canadian producers for failing to follow the successful sitcom model from the U.S., deeming the show's A story as absurd and its characters as two-dimensional. They express disapproval of the over-the-top storylines, such as forklift races, and suggest that the writers focus on finding humor in situations rather than forcibly creating funny scenarios. Additionally, they imply that the humor in the show lacks authenticity, stating that being born with a sense of humor is essential for writing genuinely funny content."
What makes this film a disappointment for viewers?,This film is self indulgent rubbish. Watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming but isn't - it's just irritating. The characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor. The stories within the film are also charmless and sinister. I was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. It is rarely that I cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us.<br /><br />Although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War. There isn't even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it. A real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to Scotland.,"This film is a total letdown, it comes across as pretentious and a waste of time. The characters lack depth and the acting falls flat. Even though it is set in a modern setting, it feels outdated and cheap. The plot fails to engage the audience, making it difficult to sit through the entire film. The lack of beautiful scenery and cinematography doesn't help redeem its quality either. Overall, it's an embarrassment to the film industry."
What was the overall atmosphere of the film like?,"It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of Russians, or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains, but far to be the Russian one. So Nicole, if you really want to talk Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation.","The film seemed to reinforce negative stereotypes about Russians and British authorities, with inaccuracies in language use by the actors. The portrayal of the characters and their actions may not sit well with those looking for more authentic representations."
What elements of Indonesian musical movies are criticized in comparison to Bollywood musical movies?,"What's with Indonesian musical movies? Never have I seen Indonesian musical movies like the ones made in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines.<br /><br />This story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks. It's a simple story plot (but it's quite focused though) with 'meant to be' musical story lines here and there.<br /><br />Confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. The main actress may try to live up the character, but it's the best that she could do, trying. As for the casting, I don't feel the necessity to put a Balinese student in that story and of course, that's not the only unnecessary characters.<br /><br />The strange thing is, why would I want to watch this movie? Maybe because of the mangoes...","The film lacks the essence of the storyline and relies heavily on poetic lines. The simple plot fails to make an impact, and the characters are unconvincing despite efforts from the main actress. The inclusion of unnecessary characters, such as the Balinese student, adds to the confusion. Overall, the film fails to captivate the audience, leaving them pondering why they would even bother watching it."
What aspects of the film disappointed the reviewer who was a fan of the original stage production?,"I admit to having been a fan of the original stage production. I never saw the movie version until very lately on cable, and watched it with anticipation, to see my memories brought alive again, because I adored the original show. Imagine my dismay.<br /><br />This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway show to film ever made. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. I was expecting a trip down memory lane, singing to the extraordinarily touching Music and the Mirror, At the Ballet, and Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen. Not! Not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they messed up the storyline, adding songs and exterior plotlines (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) not present in the original, and injecting ""drama"" where it wasn't necessary. The original had enough pathos on its own. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, don't bother. I'm sorry I wasted my time, and diluted my memories, watching this tripe.","The reviewer expressed disappointment in the film's changes to the story, songs, and overall soul of the original Broadway show. They criticized the altered music, added plotlines, and unnecessary added drama, ultimately feeling that the movie failed to capture the essence of the beloved stage production and diluted their memories."
"What disappointment did the reviewer express about the movie ""A Chorus Line""?","If you were to judge based on the movie alone, the committee that gave the stage musical ""A Chorus Line"" a Pulitzer Prize, and Broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years, were all on heavy narcotics, because one singular sensation this film certainly is NOT.<br /><br />What possessed anyone to think that Richard Attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me, but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay.<br /><br />Not content with the original score the way it was originally written, someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip. Thus we are assaulted with the Oscar-nominated(!) ""Surprise, Surprise."" Well surprise, surprise, the song stinks, and so does the movie.<br /><br />Grade: D","The reviewer criticized the movie, expressing disbelief over its accolades and questioning the director's suitability for the project. They found the film lacking in its portrayal of movement and criticized the addition of a new song, ""Surprise, Surprise,"" stating it did not enhance the movie in any way. The reviewer ultimately gave the film a grade of D."
What differences did you notice between the live musical and the movie version of this production?,"I first saw the live musical at the Denver Center For The Performing Arts and it was absolutely mind-blowing, Stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked it much more than most musicals that I have seen on the stage. The interesting thing is that you NEVER got to see Zach's face. He was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production. Whe I heard they were making a movie from it, I waited with bated breath, but when I watched the movie version I was so bummed-out disappointed that I felt I was cheated. The movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.","The movie version of the musical failed to capture the captivating mood and connection with the characters that the live production conveyed so well. The absence of Zach's face, which was so powerful on stage, felt like a missed opportunity in the film. Overall, the movie left me feeling disappointed and cheated, longing to experience the magic of the live performance again."
What are some of the major shortcomings of this film adaptation of A Chorus Line?,"This is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made. The stage version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This movie misses the mark in almost every way. Even the casting is baffling. Take Audrey Landers as Val. ""Dance 10 Looks 3"" is Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department. Yes, she finds a solution, but ultimately she's a great dancer. What do the brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great. Way to miss the boat.<br /><br />Then there's the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning over in his grave. Why didn't they use his choreography? It really can't be improved upon.","The film misses the mark in almost every aspect, from casting to choreography. The casting choices, such as Audrey Landers as Val, are baffling, deviating from the essence of the characters. Additionally, the choreography fails to capture Michael Bennett's brilliance, leaving much to be desired."
What are some of the major flaws in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical according to the critic?,"This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever. Even the music has been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false. I will say, though, that it is almost bad enough to be funny.<br /><br />The hairstyles are remarkably dated. I can not for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where ""A Chorus Line"" is playing. Are we to think that these people are auditioning for ""A Chorus Line,"" which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning? Oh no, the show is collapsing on itself.<br /><br />I saw the original production, and have listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why, did they do this?","The critic indicates that the film adaptation is a huge disappointment, with the music being ruined and the director's lack of understanding of theater evident. The critic finds the film so bad that it becomes almost comical. Additionally, the dated hairstyles and confusing opening scenes are notably criticized. The critic, who is familiar with the original production, expresses frustration over the film's shortcomings."
"What elements of the movie adaptation of the Broadway show ""A Chorus Line"" failed to capture the power and charisma of the original production?","Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway show ran for years, but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation, which most likely stems from the choice of director (Richard Attenborough, as far from B-way as you could get) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director-choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer). The slim story, about a grueling audition for a Broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor-dancer-singers, is pushed right up on us, with loud, brassy talents playing to the rafters. Nothing is modulated or subtle, particularly a laughable subplot about a ex-dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old-flame Douglas. The over-eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache, but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing; this, matched with Attenborough's sluggish pacing, spells disaster, and even the now-famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping. *1/2 from ****","The movie adaptation of ""A Chorus Line"" fell flat due to the mismatch in direction style by Richard Attenborough, who lacks Broadway experience, and lead actor Michael Douglas, who failed to embody the role of a director-choreographer effectively. The story felt forced and lacking in depth, with loud performances and an implausible subplot making it hard to connect with the characters. The hopefuls' personal struggles came off as awkward and the pacing was slow, ultimately leading to a disappointing viewing experience."
"What changes did the director make to ""A Chorus Line"" that the reviewer found disappointing?","I recently bought the DVD, forgetting just how much I hated the movie version of ""A Chorus Line."" Every change the director Attenborough made to the story failed.<br /><br />By making the Director-Cassie relationship so prominent, the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the window.<br /><br />Some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed. The show's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to Cassie's character.<br /><br />The overall staging is very self-conscious.<br /><br />The only reason I give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.","The reviewer mentioned that the director made the Director-Cassie relationship prominent, which led to the ensemble premise of the musical being undermined. Additionally, some musical numbers were rushed, with the show's hit song losing its meaning when given to Cassie's character. The overall staging was criticized for being self-conscious, and despite a few enjoyable moments, the film was perceived as draining the joy and spontaneity out of the story."
What makes this film a classic in the eyes of some viewers?,"This film is regarded by some as a classic - I've no idea why. It is terrible to the point of being laughable. The only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them.<br /><br />There are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this film, because he said I wouldn't believe how bad a film can get! He was right.<br /><br />Normally with a film this dreadful I would recommend that people shouldn't watch it, but in this case I think people should, as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective.","Some viewers consider this film a classic, but I fail to see why. It is incredibly terrible to the point of being comical. The only positive aspect of the movie is the delivery of cheesy lines, which are so cringeworthy that they elicit laughter. Despite featuring a couple of good songs and choreography, the lack of a coherent plot and a stagnant setting in a theatre make it a dull experience. Additionally, Michael Douglas's performance is lackluster. I was forced to watch this film by my brother who claimed it was unbelievably bad, and unfortunately, he was right. Generally, I would advise against watching such a dreadful film, but in this case, it might be worth seeing just to appreciate other bad movies more."
Do you think the movie's plot was too improbable and lacking in tension?,"Awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming, crisp location photography, but it's too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension. I was kinda hoping that Stanwyck wouldn't make it back in time because, really, she was saddled with the wet, in more ways than one, husband,and she had an idiot child as well..why NOT run off with Meeker? But the nagging question remains..what sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didn't float? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best she could with the material but it's threadbare.","The movie was described as a foolish potboiler with redeeming location photography, but the storyline was seen as too unbelievable to create suspense. Critics also questioned the character choices and the durability of a pier support, ultimately deeming the movie's material as threadbare."
What makes this movie fall short of being an enjoyable watch?,"Just a dumb old movie. First Stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck gets unlucky, yet again, and comes across an escaped convict. She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way. In the end her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is. All's well than ends dumb.<br /><br />I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Hollywood's glamour-oriented Golden Era; that nose is so beautiful So photogenic The film is mercifully short, running a little over an hour. It's as though the director sensed that he was making crap, so he thought it best to keep the crap short.","The movie is filled with unrealistic and nonsensical occurrences that make the plot feel dumb and disconnected. From the poorly executed scenarios where characters get their feet trapped in dumb ways to Stanwyck's unconvincing performance, the film fails to engage the audience in a meaningful way. Additionally, the rushed pacing and lackluster storytelling further contribute to the overall disappointment of the movie."
"** What aspects of the remake of ""The Haunting of Hill House"" do viewers who are familiar with the original material find disappointing?

**","For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"") and have never seen the 1963 Robert Wise production with Julie Harris, this remake will seem pretty darn bad.<br /><br />For those of us who have, it is just plain awful.<br /><br />Bad acting (what was Neeson thinking?), goofy computer enhancements, and a further move away from Jackson's story doom this remake.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. It still effectively scares without hokey special effects. The acting is professional and believable.<br /><br />For readers of the book, the from 1963 follows the it much closer.","** The remake of ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is widely criticized by viewers familiar with the original book and 1963 film adaptation. The acting is deemed subpar, especially questioning Liam Neeson's performance. The use of cheesy computer effects takes away from the eerie atmosphere, and the deviation from the original story leaves fans feeling let down. It is strongly advised for viewers to stick to the original movie for a more professional and believable scare experience."
"What are the major flaws in the adaptation of ""The Haunting""?","Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting"" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with trepidation. I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!","The new version of ""The Haunting"" fails to capture the essence of the original film, which relied on innovative camera-work and lighting to generate fear. Instead, this adaptation is poorly written, badly executed, and relies heavily on special effects and pyrotechnics. Despite having talented actors like Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones, the film falls short and should only be seen as an example of studio mishandling."
What are some aspects that led to the disappointment of this remake movie?,"The original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any ""monster"" , it just SUGGESTED scary ""things"" , .<br /><br />This version however shows every aspect of a ""sick minded ghost"" , including unnecessary special effects . <br /><br />The ""mystery "" ,as presented in the original movie , was the most scary part : one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened. By showing the face of the ""old man"" , this Mister has completely disappeared. Even worse : the special effects ( crying wooden children faces) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original","The original movie did a great job of building suspense and mystery by suggesting scary elements, but this remake chose to show everything, including unnecessary special effects. The reveal of the ghost's face and the over-the-top special effects took away from the eerie atmosphere of the original and made this remake seem more ridiculous than scary."
What kind of bonehead would give this movie a 10 rating?,"This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made,,,, it had everything to make a movie great. Incredible acting, awesome special effects...... oh wait I must be thinking of a good movie. Well this wasn't one of them, it just plain sucked. <br /><br />What I want to know is, what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10. When I casted my vote there were 206 out there, god knows what goes on in their head. Now as for any other vote, a 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10??? Come on, what made this movie sooooo good to give it a 10? I know these are the same 206 that thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.","The movie just plain sucked. The acting was terrible, special effects were not even close to awesome. It's incomprehensible that anyone would rate this movie so highly, let alone as a perfect 10."
What changes were made to the story that the reviewer disliked in the remake of the movie?,"They screwed up this story! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads getting chopped, wires cutting peoples faces, and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What the hell is that about??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no ceiling hand. It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person. They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Taking away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She only wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story! I hate this damn remake!","The reviewer criticized the addition of excessive violence, unrealistic elements like a giant hand on the ceiling, and a heroic portrayal of the protagonist, Nell, which they believed went against the essence of the original movie and book. They expressed a strong preference for the original's ability to scare without relying on gore or supernatural elements."
"What aspects of the film did the reviewer find lacking in ""The Haunting""?","The Haunting. A remake, of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller, and one that has improved with time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the ""I'm gonna get us outta here"" fellow, the oh so sensitive bookworm). But, seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the ""star"", I guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Mewing cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children that can't speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked you since ""The Cowboys"". Stop it.","The reviewer expressed disappointment in the lack of character development, noting that the characters felt more like caricatures. Additionally, the special effects in the movie were criticized as laughable, with mewing cherubs, stretchy doors, and irritating dead children that failed to impress. The ending was also deemed as idiotically sappy, attempting to inject unnecessary sentimentality."
What was disappointing about the film the reviewer mentioned?,"There were only two things that kept me interested in this film: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones.<br /><br />This was basically a one woman show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye-candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first one and he did redeem himself with Road to Perdition.<br /><br />I don't know what director Jan de Bont's problem was. he did a great job with Speed and Twister. he really fell down on the job here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed 2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, else this would be the worst picture of 1999.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.","The film was described as having a weak script with some actors like Liam Neeson being wasted in unnecessary roles. The director was criticized for not delivering a good job, especially compared to his previous successful films. This movie is advised to be avoided completely."
"Do you think the 1999 remake of ""The Haunting of Hill House"" lives up to the original version?","It's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. I was left shaking my head and asking, why? The acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but couldn't believe it was that bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; ""Well they got your money!"" She's right, don't let them get yours. If there's no profit in making lousy re-makes, maybe they'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience","The 1999 remake of ""The Haunting of Hill House"" fails to capture the essence of the original film, with wooden acting, unrecognizable story changes, and an over-reliance on special effects that detract from the subtle horror of the original. Many viewers were left disappointed by the lack of quality in this remake, which failed to do justice to the source material."
What elements of the movie stood out despite the poor acting and storyline?,"Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual creaks and moans attempt to make-up for a muddled, but thin story. Acting is barely above pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess. Owen Wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror-movie history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to look at and not much else although Lili Tayor did an above-average job. The special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous. However they can't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute. Don't bother.",The special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous.
What was the most cringe-worthy line of dialogue in the movie and who should consider pursuing a different acting path?,"I don't even know where to begin on this one. ""It's all about the family."" That has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a ""horror"" movie, although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried!!! Ugh!!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man did co-write ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore."" He does have some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There's no room in legitimate acting for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.","The dialogue in this movie was so bad, especially the line ""It's all about the family,"" which really stood out as just awful. The acting from actors like Owen Wilson, Lily Taylor, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was also subpar, with Wilson being typecast into roles where he ends up as the token guy who dies, Taylor not fitting in the genre, and Zeta-Jones being better off in a different industry according to the reviewer. This critic strongly feels that this movie is one of the worst they have ever seen."
What makes the dialogue of the bad guy and bad girl in the movie stand out?,"Normally I wouldn't feel qualified to review something I only saw a half hour of, but I'll make an exception for this one.<br /><br />Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here's some of the bad guy's lines: ""I smell...teacher!"" ""Sorry, teacher! You get an 'F!'""<br /><br />Bad guy and bad girl ( right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs, they're getting hot and heavy):<br /><br />Him -""So how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders?""<br /><br />Her- (purrs) ""You sure know how to show a girl a good time..."" One generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone, gets to sum up his life and personality in this line -""I AM a CHICKEN-TWIT! (this was the USA network version) My old man was right! No wonder he left us..."" Boo-hoo.<br /><br />(Not actually a spoiler ) Bad guy (on fire) screams ""Aargh! Fire!""","The dialogue of the bad guy and bad girl in the movie is cringeworthy and lacks depth. The lines like ""I smell...teacher!"" and ""You get an 'F!'"" come off as cheesy and unoriginal. The romantic interaction between the two characters after committing serious crimes is disturbing and unrealistic. The portrayal of the generic kid as a coward with a poor relationship with his father feels forced and uninspired. The attempt at drama with lines like ""Aargh! Fire!"" falls flat and comes across as laughable rather than intense."
What makes Detention such a great movie for Dolph Lundgren fans?,"I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend.<br /><br />In summary: Terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it. Hilarious.",Detention is a hilarious action movie filled with absurd and comedic moments that will guarantee laughs. It's a must-watch for fans of Dolph Lundgren and over-the-top action clichés.
What is the main premise of the movie?,"Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, even though he did save many other captive children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways, bathrooms and even class rooms. In other words, the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren,(Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. However, the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it, if you decided to View IT !","The story starts off intriguingly with a soldier turned teacher who grapples with a haunting past, but as the film progresses, the plot becomes chaotic and unconvincing. Dolph Lundgren's performance fails to elevate the movie, leaving viewers disappointed and questioning their decision to watch it."
"What are some of the reasons for the negative review of the film ""Hatred of A Minute""?","It took 9 years to complete this film. I would think that within those 9 years someone would have said,hey, this film is terrible. I've seen better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and played. Abused child turns into serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about abused child turns into a florist? At least that would have been a new twist. Why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially unoriginal movie ideas) thinks that they can be a director? I do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed. That shows tenacity and spirit. With this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script. If you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer/director from Michigan see Hatred of A Minute. If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer/director stick with Evil Dead.","The film ""Hatred of A Minute"" was criticized for its unoriginal and tired storyline, with the reviewer suggesting that the concept of an abused child turning into a serial killer lacked creativity. The acting was also deemed subpar, with comparisons made to adult film performances. Additionally, the reviewer questioned the director's ability, expressing a desire for a more innovative script and storyline."
Can you tell me about the characters in the movie?,"This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the lot, and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a full-length film make. Poor Sid Caesar as the vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it's hard to watch him. As the sly tailor, Robert Morse hasn't an ounce of charm. Neither does his hapless nephew (Jason Carter) The ""songs"" are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down. The direction is practically nonexistent, and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is pretty as the emperor's daughter, but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the minor players. And the film crawls at a snails pace. Hans Christian Andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared. It can honestly be said, at least of this movie tale, it's no surprise that it went straight to video oblivion.","This Cannon Movie Tale is a complete disaster. The performances by Sid Caesar and Robert Morse are cringeworthy, lacking any charm or talent. The songs are unbearable and only serve to slow down the already nonexistent plot. The direction is practically non-existent, and the supporting characters add nothing to the film. Even the pretty appearance of Lysette Anthony as the emperor's daughter cannot save this mess. The pacing of the movie is painfully slow, and it's no wonder this film went straight to video oblivion."
What aspects of the movie may make it feel more amusing than scary?,"This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like. And, come to think of it, the plot is rather disgusting actually...but handled with some kind of taste. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The ""monster"", after it is exposed, isn't very scary either unfortunately. The somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it, making it appear as a TV-movie more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic...","The movie may offer some unsettling moments and have a sleazy quality to it that some viewers might appreciate. However, there are significant gaps where nothing interesting happens, and the ending drags on, losing its tense climax. The ""monster"" reveal falls flat, and the overall look of the movie comes off as drab, resembling a TV-movie rather than a theatrical production."
What are some disappointing aspects of the movie?,"Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror.<br /><br />The plot, an extremely tired one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.","The devious unseen killer reveal was underwhelming, and Stephen Furst's performance leaned more towards comedy than horror. The plot was quite cliched, with predictable character arcs and an unoriginal storyline."
Was the movie scary and enjoyable to watch?,"I purchased this movie at a car boot sale, so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977) but I thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch. However, it proved to be not at all enjoyable, but instead the acting and the general movie was mock-able, such as the ways the the 'unsees killer' murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror film. I say this because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Three blonde women in danger, the majority get killed. 2) One survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help arrives in the form of a shotgun!<br /><br />By using three simple points, I have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie, so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it.","No, the movie was not enjoyable at all as the acting and general plot were mockable, featuring cliche horror tropes and stereotypical scenes like blonde women in danger and a predictable ending with a shotgun as the saving grace."
What makes this horror film lackluster and uninteresting?,"Dreck about three beautiful women in California who go to cover some festival (or something). All the hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house. What they don't know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there who likes to kill...<br /><br />Yawn. Boring, pointless, utterly stupid ""horror"" film. Bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull DULL! Bach and her friends are no actresses--their faces are blank all the way through. The final ""revelation"" is laughably predictable and there's no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way. There is some expected gratuitous female nudity but that's not enough to save this. Boring, pointless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.","The film is described as boring, pointless, and utterly stupid. The actresses are criticized for their lack of emotion, making the movie dull and unengaging. The final twist is deemed predictable, and the absence of blood or gore fails to maintain viewer interest. Despite some gratuitous nudity, the overall film is considered to be uninspiring and forgettable."
What makes this movie lackluster in comparison to other films in the same genre?,"This movie features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the ""special effects"" that this is a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. Not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary.","The movie ""Dr. Hackenstein"" fails to impress with its average score and mediocre performance by David Muir in the titular role. The low budget becomes apparent through the lackluster special effects and unremarkable cast, making it indistinguishable from other similar horror/comedy movies. Fans of nude scenes or bad movies will also be disappointed as there is nothing memorable about this film. Despite featuring Anne Ramsey and Phyllis Diller, there is nothing to look forward to in this unexciting movie."
Can you think of a worse movie than this one?,"There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie. They took a sleazy story, miscast it, miswrote it, misfilmed it. It has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story.<br /><br />As badly as it fails as art, it fails even worse as commerce. Who could have been the target market for this. What age group? What interest group?<br /><br />Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. That I would pay to see.<br /><br />I've seen thousands of bad movies, and this ranks with ""Sailor Who Fell from Grace"" and ""Manos"" ... my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies I've ever seen. Everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with VanDamme for all eternity.<br /><br />I challenge you. Watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take this and make it worse? I can't think of one way.","This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish - the story is trashy, the dialogue is poorly delivered, and the casting is completely off. It's a movie that fails in every aspect and it's hard to believe that anyone would actually enjoy it. I've seen my fair share of bad movies, but this one definitely ranks among the worst."
"What are some major flaws in the movie ""The Lonely Lady""?","Even when I saw this movie at a teenager, I wondered just how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Ms. Zadora is, even she couldn't keep this sorry-ass excuse of a movie from tanking. Not even her photoshoot for Penthouse, in which ""The Lonely Lady"" was promoted ""back in the day,"" could keep this movie from tanking. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Give this one a miss.","The movie ""The Lonely Lady"" failed to impress despite having the beautiful and sexy Pia Zadora in the lead role. The storyline was lacking, and even Zadora's charm couldn't rescue it from being a disappointment. The film's reliance on a weak script ultimately led to its downfall."
What was the most cringe-worthy scene in the movie?,"I simply could not finish this movie. I tuned out after what I would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic.","The scene where Pia Zadora is put in an uncomfortable situation involving sexual suggestion was not only distasteful but also poorly executed, making it impossible for some viewers to continue watching the movie."
What is a standout moment in the movie that makes it entertaining despite its flaws?,"The super sexy B movie actress has another bit part as future ""Goodfellas"" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this box office bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialog, well, one WORD of dialog actually. She shouts out ""Joe!"" as Ray's character is violating poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so bad though it becomes funny, hilarious at times. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly Pia's character is freaking out. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah, right. Pia can barely talk, let alone write! Pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her bit part in this cat's opinion! Rock on Glory!","The standout moment in this movie is the hilarious scene at the end where Pia Zadora has a nervous breakdown, accompanied by cheesy editing and effects. It's so bad that it becomes funny, and the guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love it! Despite the overall bad quality of the film, this particular scene provides some comedic relief."
Do you think this film has the potential to gain critical acclaim and awards recognition?,"The truth is that a film based on a Harold Robbins novel is not going to win any awards. This is no exception. ""The Lonely Lady"" is a pure B picture in budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a made-for-tv film. The acting is very uneven. Joseph Cali is especially terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As one reviewer said of a certain Katherine Hepburn performance, her range goes from A to B. Ms Zedora manages to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. Still, the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you're looking for some fun...and you're not too sober...this could be for you.","The truth is that a film based on a Harold Robbins novel is not going to win any awards. This is no exception.

What similarities do critics point out between Pet Sematary and the Italian movie ZEDER?,"Pet Sematary , though a nice 80's Horror movie, with a nice Director and atmosphere, IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It's clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the book)<br /><br />The cat, the ground, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiary , but, being Stephen Kind a famous American writer , it's totally normal that he can get away with this , it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italians movies with no -budget (and in part, it's crap itself ... ) but the original idea, I repeat it, it's Italian director Avati<br /><br />Let the world know",'
What element of the movie stands out and makes it worth watching despite its flaws?,"Fot the most part, this movie feels like a ""made-for-TV"" effort. The direction is ham-fisted, the acting (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwrought and soapy. Denise Crosby, particularly, delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card. Only one thing makes this film worth watching, and that is once Gage comes back from the ""Semetary."" There is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone, and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason. It is absolutely bone-chilling. This film only does one thing right, but it knocks that one thing right out of the park. Worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.","The movie feels cheap and poorly directed, with most of the acting coming off as melodramatic and uninspiring. Denise Crosby's delivery is particularly unconvincing, making it seem like she's reading lines off a cue card. The only saving grace of this film is the chilling portrayal of a small child turning into a murderer after returning from the ""Semetary."" While this aspect is disturbingly captivating, the rest of the movie falls short in quality."
"What are some drawbacks of the movie ""Frank's Fantasies""?",For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding Franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings... The problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies/funny situations again and again and again. It is to predictable. It is more done as a TV story where you can go away and come back without missing anything.<br /><br />I like Felix Herngren as Frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience....<br /><br />,"The repetitiveness of the fantasies and comedic situations in the film make it too predictable and more suited for a TV show where you can easily step away without missing anything. Despite Felix Herngren's performance as Frank being likable, the lack of variation and a meaningful message prevent the comedy from truly shining."
"What are some of the shortcomings of the movie ""Incubus""?","Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has little going for it.<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence, it lack narrative sensibility and ""characters"".<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or, to be more precise, rape.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage.<br /><br />The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.","The movie ""Incubus"" is criticized for its lack of narrative sensibility, poorly developed characters, and a gory yet empty plot revolving around a demon with a graphic and absurdly large penis. The film fails to explore its potentially interesting themes and instead resorts to slow-moving and vapid storytelling."
"What is the main issue with the movie ""The Incubus""?","You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and ""The Incubus"" is a dreadful, worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills. Actually, observing the hammy script and John Hough's 'baroque' art direction, one can hardly blame him. The movie has something to do with a series of rape-murders going on in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in. Somehow, the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene, and Cassavetes seems visibly P.O.'ed at times. The Incubus itself, which doesn't show up until the last scene, is a well-done creation, but it's not worth waiting for.<br /><br />1/10","""The Incubus"" is a disappointing film where even the usually brilliant John Cassavetes seems disinterested and the director fails to create any tension or engagement throughout the movie. The supernatural theme and the late appearance of the Incubus do little to redeem the dull script and hammy art direction. Overall, the film falls flat, earning a measly 1 out of 10 rating."
What makes this movie memorable despite its flaws?,"I rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is THE worst movie I have ever seen. This isn't one of those ""it was so bad, it was funny"". This isn't one of those ""it was so gory, it leaves you with a bad feeling"" movies. It wasn't even one of those ""what the heck was that?"" movies. I can't recall the performance of the actors, but it was poorly shot, the story was disjointed, and it had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry that I had wasted the time.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of movies I didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and/or story-telling, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties. The incubus has none.<br /><br />I actually contemplated NOT making a comment on this ""piece"" for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity, but I am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie.",
Did you enjoy the diversity of comedy styles showcased in the movie?,"Do you like stand up? Then stay away from this...<br /><br />During the early rounds, there are in fact good comics, but unless they got some cute qualities, they got a snowballs chance. Any controversial material and you are OUT! ...and I think I hurt as much as the discarded comedians, when I see who the crooked judges are letting in.<br /><br />1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries. Half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs. Several of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges doesn't seem to have problems with.<br /><br />It is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on TV, but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been.<br /><br />If the producers changed the name of the contest to ""Last Clown Standing"", all my criticism would loose validity. Maybe an idea?","Stay away from this stand-up comedy show if you enjoy a variety of comedy styles. The early rounds feature some good comics, but those with controversial material are quickly eliminated due to the biased judges. It's frustrating to see mediocre comedians advance while talented ones are left behind. Many finalists fail to deliver laughs, and some are even accused of stealing material. While the show is more entertaining than other TV programs, it falls short of its potential. Perhaps renaming it ""Last Clown Standing"" would better reflect its flaws."
What motivated Harry to handle the blackmailers and the situation with his wife the way he did in the movie?,"Spoilers ahead -- proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car up to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic.<br /><br />Okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit, or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence (e.g, Cini's body?) This was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it. After that, it sort of falls apart.","The main issue with the movie lies in Harry's handling of the blackmailers and the situation with his wife. He easily discovers the identities of the blackmailers but inexplicably continues to give in to their demands. The plot takes a far-fetched turn when he decides to wire his car to explode with the money inside, making it a hard leap of logic for the audience. While his desire to keep his affair with Cini a secret is understandable, his actions post that point lack believability. The movie, which initially had an interesting premise, ultimately falls apart in the final third."
Can the movie be considered a waste of time and money?,"I would rather of had my eyes gouged out with rusty ice picks than have had to sit through this abortion. There is no plot. There is no acting ability . Ray Liota has shamed himself and should be blacklisted from any more work. I am so sorry that the industry allows crap like this to be shown on any type of medium. <br /><br />Rumor has it that Maddona threw herself to the floor to break her other arm so she could be taken away on a stretcher. Actullly, she deserves to be married to this loser and wanna-be-actor-director. I hope she stays in London and never returns to the USA. Please do not waste your money on this so called film. I beg of you.",
What makes Revolver a disappointing movie for the reviewer?,"Its like if you took the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave ""i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of"" film maker rubbish, mashed in a few extra styles for good measure, chopped off the ending, there you have Revolver.<br /><br />Yes, I did think about it for a little bit after watching, and yes it did kind of make sense, however that doesn't stop it being garbage.<br /><br />Waste of money. Waste of time.<br /><br />Up there as the worst Movie I have ever seen, with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little.","The reviewer found Revolver to be a pretentious and nonsensical film that failed to deliver any redeeming qualities, labeling it as a waste of both money and time. The movie was criticized for lacking style, class, and a coherent ending, ultimately being deemed one of the worst films ever seen by the reviewer."
What are the main characteristics of the female lead in this movie?,"There are so many comments on this film, yet I found them to be misleading. This a corner-cutting, over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Boy meets girl. Girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. Boy is intrigued. <br /><br />You know the drill: The antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath... Toss in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from The Breakfast Club simply reeks as a lead character. And all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie.","The female lead in this movie is portrayed as cliche, unoriginal, and unconvincing. The storyline of a normal person turning into a partner in crime with someone of the opposite sex for no valid reason feels overdone and lacks depth. The performance and character development of the lead actress fail to bring any authenticity or originality to the film. Ultimately, the movie comes across as lazy and predictable, making it a forgettable viewing experience."
Could you please tell me more about the plot of the movie?,"This is one of the worse cases of film drivel I have seen in a long while. It is so awful, that I am not sure where to begin, or even if it is worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' as he puts in a decent performance for his part. But that plot ... Oh dear oh dear. I particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top, whilst the helicopter is on the way. A climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes! I could go on: but it isn't worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of) the rest is drivel. Sorry folks, but this is about as bad as film making gets.","The plot of this movie is extremely disappointing and cringe-worthy. It is filled with nonsensical events and unrealistic scenarios that make it hard to take the film seriously. The main character's sudden teleportation from the foot of a mountain to the top in mere minutes is just one example of the absurdity present throughout. Overall, the plot is predictable, poorly executed, and a major drawback to enjoying the film."
What negative aspects are highlighted in this review?,"Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallonethat should have been enoughand featuring too many rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care ""Bostid!"" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. No deathless lines in this one. No living lines, either.","This film received a scathing review, criticizing the poor writing, overuse of rock-climbing scenes, weak plotlines, lackluster performances, and absence of memorable lines. The reviewer particularly points out Sylvester Stallone's unimpressive acting and John Lithgow's disappointing portrayal, and deems the overall production as awful and forgettable. The review also expresses regret for Janine Turner's wasted talent in a poorly written role."
What are some unrealistic aspects and inconsistencies in the movie that made it hard to believe?,"There are some Stallone movies I like, but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days. Also, in all this wilderness Stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices. Also, the Treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. Also, bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons.<br /><br />I liked John Lithgow's villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys, or all of them getting killed. Eventually I just couldn't believe the character anymore.<br /><br />Not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to watch.","The movie had numerous unrealistic elements such as terrorists being overly prepared, convenient shortcuts appearing in the wilderness, lack of coordination between authorities, and bad guys with high-tech weapons failing to hit their targets. The antagonist, played by John Lithgow, was initially intriguing but his lack of regard for his own allies made his character unbelievable. Overall, the movie is deemed not worth renting or watching."
Do you think the movie accurately portrays rock climbing?,"I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity. (For one, if Stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there's no need to carry any gear, but I guess those dangling carabiners look sorta ""mountain climby,"" so let's throw them in). For those lobotomized folks who think that Colorado looks anything like the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), well the Hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.","The portrayal of rock climbing in the movie is seen as ridiculous and unrealistic by viewers, from the unnecessary gear to the inaccurate portrayal of locations."
What elements of the movie were praised despite some viewers finding the characters' behaviors illogical?,"I don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment on, I was irritated. Of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do the criminals act dumb, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? Why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I just can give this movie 1 point...","Although some viewers found the characters' decisions unrealistic and illogical, many praised the movie for its exciting action sequences and stunning landscape scenery."
Who is the central figure guiding the training of cadets in the film?,"There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.","Pat O'Brien portrays Major Chick Davis, a character who embodies a balance of strict military discipline and understanding, ultimately shaping the cadets into skilled bombardiers. O'Brien's performance shines as he effortlessly navigates the complexities of his role, providing a solid foundation for the film's storyline. The movie is further elevated by the impressive special effects showcased in the climactic moments."
What are some of the strengths and weaknesses of this movie?,"Philip. K. Dickian movie. And a decent one for that matter. Better than the Paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But lets face it, the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me. Half way through the movie I already started to fear about such kind of ending, and I was regrettably right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. No, not at all. First half (as already many here have commented) is awesome. There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future (we will do such kind on corny sf things because we CAN) or is it simply over combining. But the paranoia is there and feeling ""out of joint"" also. Good one.","This movie has been praised for its Philip K. Dickian style that sets it apart from other films like Paycheck and Minority Report. The first half of the movie has been described as awesome and full of paranoia, creating a feeling of being ""out of joint"". However, some viewers found the twisting and cheesing ending to be a bit too much, leading to disappointment and regret over predicting the ending midway through."
Do you agree with the comparison between Cypher and Cube in terms of quality and engagement?,"Somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode from The Twilight Zone trying to get out. Whereas Cube was taut, well-made, claustrophobic and mind-engaging, I'm afraid Cypher is a bloated, tedious rehash of several well-worn themes which just don't add up to much, especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before.<br /><br />Cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending. None of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it is most definitely not a good one.<br /><br />When you've watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film, but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating.","The movie Cypher fails to deliver a captivating experience, feeling bloated and tedious with worn-out themes. The characters lack chemistry, and the technology appears outdated. The film's directorial quality is a far cry from Cube, leaving viewers disappointed by its lack of inspiration and intrigue. While not terrible, Cypher certainly falls short of being a good sci-fi film, making it a passable option only when other activities seem more appealing."
What are some areas of improvement for the show and the comedian's performance?,"I have given this show (I have only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes/set-ups appear to fail. Some are not funny outright, but some are amusing -- in a 12 year old boy kind of way. She reminds me of that New York painter who throws paint upon a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what she's got, including the kitchen sink, while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different.<br /><br />However what she's ""got"" often times is not enough, as though she lacks the kind of follow-through a good comedian needs to succeed.<br /><br />The whole enterprise is like an under done potato.","The show has been deemed lacking in successful jokes and set-ups, often falling flat in humor. The comedian is compared to a painter who haphazardly throws things out in hopes that some will stick, indicating a lack of substance and follow-through in her comedic approach."
What are some reasons why viewers may not find Sarah Silverman's humor engaging or enjoyable?,"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn-worthy. She's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous. The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine.<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a ""dumb chick."" I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says ""Watch my show or I'll kill my dog,"" is actually believable. I know she's a wanna be comedienne. She just comes across as a warped nut-case. I just don't ever want to see her around MY dog.","The way Sarah Silverman delivers her lines is boring and lacking in humor, making her comedy segments yawn-worthy and uninteresting. Viewers might find her deadpan style to be dead on arrival, with some even perceiving her as annoying and a wanna-be comedienne."
What aspects of the movie did you find particularly disappointing or unimpressive?,"Can we say retarded? This girl has no talent what so ever, nothing but complete garbage. You people are just marking 10 stars because you know most people hate this pathetic woman, if its such a ""great"" show then why did it get canceled after 6 measly episodes? exactly. People that support her, please seek help you do NOT know what is funny. Her stand up comedy is just so stupid, seriously how do you find this trash funny? The show tries to poke fun at stereo types and other things that are not funny at all. Carlos Mencia is funny and to that stupid poster, he actually has fans and his show is on the air so I'm sorry your a redneck who doesen't get his jokes. Please give me my 20 minutes of my life back.",The movie lacked originality and relied heavily on worn-out stereotypes. The humor fell flat and the attempts at comedy were juvenile and uninspiring. It failed to capture any genuine laughs and felt forced throughout. The show's cancellation after only six episodes speaks volumes about its lack of appeal and creativity.
What were your expectations from the show?,"Comedy Central has had success with original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the hugely popular Colbert Report all star professional comics and all are, or in the case of Chapelle Show, were, solid shows. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I was expecting good stuff when I tuned in.<br /><br />I was so disappointed.<br /><br />There were some mildly funny sequences, but given that the star is the caliber of Silverman, the show could have been much better. It was just the pilot, and hopefully next week's show will be better. If not, get her some help in the form of better writers for the show.","The show was expected to be much better given the caliber of Sarah Silverman as a comic, but unfortunately, it was disappointing. There were only a few mildly funny scenes and it was hoped that the next episode would improve significantly."
What aspects of the program did the reviewer find disappointing or poorly executed?,"I had just watched one episode of this program and I couldn't even get to the end of the program. Every minute I had watched this program my I.Q must of dropped about 10 points. This is basically like a children's program but with swearing. Not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh. Anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded, disappointing, horribly acted program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons.","The reviewer found the program to be like a children's show with swearing, lacking humor, poorly written, badly acted, and overall a source of disappointment."
Did the movie live up to the expectations and potential suggested by the IMDb write-up?,"I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember, and find I understand many of the things my kids love. But this is pathetic. I cannot say I have seen any by Sarah except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see her as anything special. But this show is just so far below what I expected from her. The IMDb write up made it sound like potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off half way through. Anything else is better that that. Jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is inly moved to turn you off. I just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy. Only good thing I can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here, saving other shows from such an embarrassment.","The movie was a major disappointment, with jokes that felt more suitable for a young child rather than an adult audience. The humor fell flat, and the overall quality was below what was anticipated based on the reputation of the lead actress, Sarah. It's hard to believe that this comedy was even financed, as it came across as an insult to the genre. Turning off the first episode halfway through was a common sentiment among viewers, highlighting the lackluster delivery and insipid content."
What expectations were not met by the movie in terms of the story and characters?,"Considering its popularity, I found this movie a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this film. After all, it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that I could root for, since the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to be high art, but I found the movie boring. Definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre. Its cult status escapes me. I recommend you to skip it.",
Was this movie able to meet the expectations of the viewers who are fans of Shaw Bros. movies?,"I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater.), and I had high expectations for this one since I found it listed on many ""10 Best Kung Fu/Martial Arts Movies"" websites. (I'm now convinced that those 10 Best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all, there's barely any action in the film. Most of the movie consists of talking about the plot, which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978, but it's routine by today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they ship is terrible; the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16:9 enhanced.","This movie was a major disappointment to fans of Shaw Bros. movies. The lack of action scenes and the thin plot left much to be desired. Additionally, the quality of the DVD shipped by Netflix was subpar, with a horrendous picture quality that was not even 16:9 enhanced."
Can you tell me a bit about the plot of the movie and the overall atmosphere?,"Apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called ""movie."" They described ""blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence."" I saw no ""intrigue."" I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I saw no ""violence."" At least, I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with ""impervious"" skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the ""plot."" Furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. Whatever you may choose to do, I will always remain<br /><br /> Correct,<br /><br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /><br /> <br /><br />P.S. I was not blinded by the choreography.",
What elements in the film did not work well together according to the reviewer's feedback?,"Having enjoyed Jean Arthur in ""The Devil and Miss Jones"", my interest was peaked, so I tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey--but I didn't make it to the end. Arthur, photographed in a gauzy, movie-magazine fashion, either wants alimony from ex-husband William Powell or another shot at marriage, but I never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks (she's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness, but once inside a morgue--like all women in these '30's comedies--she faints). William Powell reportedly had a high time working with Miss Arthur, but you'd never know it from the end result; they look awkward standing next to each other, hesitant over their banter. The actor playing Powell's valet is excruciating, and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease.","The chemistry between the lead actors William Powell and Jean Arthur falls flat, with awkward interactions and banter. The character development of Arthur's role felt superficial, lacking depth and emotional connection, leading to a lackluster viewing experience. The supporting actor's performance was criticized as excruciating, and the attempts at humor throughout the movie felt forced and uncomfortable, failing to elicit genuine laughs from the audience."
Can you summarize the plot of the movie Surviving Christmas?,"Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O' Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Dumped by his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie doesn't want to be left alone on Christmas so he decides to return to his boyhood home, imposing on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family. An obnoxious and one-dimensional performance by Affleck, who mainly acts with a flashy smile, makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and O' Hara breathe some life into this mess. Even for farce, its silliness is lumbering, not much makes sense from scene to scene, and its sentimental messages are as phony as Affleck's grin. 91 min., rated PG-13. * ½","The movie ""Surviving Christmas"" features an obnoxious and one-dimensional performance by Ben Affleck, who comes off as a mentally unbalanced creep. Despite some efforts by James Gandolfini and Catherine O' Hara to breathe life into the film, its silliness is overwhelming and the sentimental messages feel phony. The plot lacks coherence, making it difficult for the audience to follow from scene to scene."
What did you think about the movie overall?,"So, I know that I voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project.<br /><br />James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good too, but the story sucked and I encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover, but to just walk away...I don't even want to get into what the movie is about, because it is too stupid to pontificate about.<br /><br />Don't rent this! It's horrible! Horrible!","The movie is not worth watching. Despite some good performances by James G. and Catherine O'Hara, as well as Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate, the story is terrible and unrealistic. The reviewer described it as stupid, absurd, and horrible, advising people to not even give it a chance."
Can you predict every plot turn right from the start of the movie?,"May contain spoilers.<br /><br />I say that, but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start.<br /><br />This is not a movie that I liked. I didn't hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence, but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending. There were funny bits along the way to be sure, but few were original. At least it didn't go for the gutter.<br /><br />Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature. Everyone else is a cardboard cutout, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have made this as a favor to someone.<br /><br />All in all, it's a harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.","This movie felt too predictable overall, with few original funny moments. The performances were decent, with only Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck managing to bring some appeal to their scenes. The rest of the characters felt flat and uninteresting, making the film feel like a forgettable, run-of-the-mill experience."
Was this movie a complete waste of time?,"This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies ever. I cannot even imagine Gigli being worse that this. Previews made us say ""NO"", but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot.<br /><br />STUPID US.<br /><br />Affleck is NOT an actor. He's an image and can look good with explosions, but not even the kind Bruce Willis got in ""Die Hard"". If he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys, it would be a comedy.<br /><br />The best part was Catherine O'Hara -- she's always good. Gandolfini flops again (if it weren't for The Sopranos, he'd be washed up) like he did in ""The Mexican"".<br /><br />Affleck hogs every scene and as others have said -- no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions. <br /><br />AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.","Yes! This movie was an absolute disaster. It's filled with terrible acting, a nonsensical plot, and a complete lack of character development. The only redeeming quality was Catherine O'Hara's performance, but even that couldn't save this trainwreck. Ben Affleck's attempt at acting was laughable at best, and James Gandolfini's portrayal was a major disappointment. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this cinematic disaster."
What are some drawbacks of the movie?,"I went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when I got in the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! This shouted to me that this film is not very good. <br /><br />Not to my surprise, the film was dire. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him. His acting is OKish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good. The plot line is poor and the comedy almost non-existent.<br /><br />However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny.<br /><br />I hope this review stops other people wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room!!!","The film's plot is predictable, the comedy is lacking, and the lead actor's performance is mediocre at best."
"What happens when a wealthy yet obnoxious man pays a family to be his ""family"" for Christmas in the movie?","Drew Latham(Ben Affleck)is determined not to be lonely this Christmas. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also obnoxious and guilty of being very grandiose. Drew goes back to the home he grew up in and offers the family living there, the Valco's, $250,000 to be his ""family"" through the Christmas season. Tom Valco(James Gandolfini)is reluctant, but is greedy enough to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco(Catherine O'Hara)has little to say in the matter, but learns to like having Drew around...not exactly the same sentiment with daughter Alicia(Christina Applegate), but that too has room for change. Drew's girlfriend Missy(Jennifer Morrison)tracks down Drew and wants her folks to meet his family. Genuine fun is in store as a happy Noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare. Other members of the cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comedic, albeit strange.","In this movie, Drew Latham, played by Ben Affleck, offers the Valco family $250,000 to be his temporary family for the Christmas season. Despite some reluctance from the Valcos, comedic chaos ensues as they navigate this unusual arrangement, leading to a mix of heartwarming moments and a good dose of quirky humor. Affleck shines in his comedic role, adding a strange yet entertaining element to the film."
What are some of the reasons why this movie did not sit well with the reviewer?,"This thing is horrible. The Ben Affleck character is self-centered and gleefully sadistic--punch-you-in-the-nose fratboy sadistic. And he's the romantic HERO! His cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end, but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness.<br /><br />If I were a Socialist, I would screed beyond belief, but I'm not a Socialist.<br /><br />We capitalists like a little Christmas magic from time to time. This ain't magic. I don't know what it is. It's just awful. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late '70s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underused. If Ben was out of the equation, these folks might have dreamed up something excellent.",
What are some major flaws in the film?,"This is quite possibly the worst Christmas film ever. The plot is virtually non-existent, the acting (Affleck in particular) is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree. As far as I could gather the plot consisted of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. On doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas... and that is it. The film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family.... blah blah blah.","This Christmas movie is a disaster - the storyline goes nowhere, the acting falls flat (especially Ben Affleck), and the overall experience is a forgettable mess. Even die-hard Affleck fans will struggle to defend this poorly executed film."
What makes this movie so disappointing to watch?,"James Gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish. Affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it, the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable. I saw this in the USA in an empty theatre, I soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I walked out before the end it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when back in England I saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo ""Paul Ross"" in one of the down market Sundays. I always rely on Ross to save me money on cinema tickets, if he says the movie is good, I get straight on this very website to check it out. This movie should have gone straight to £1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you.","Despite having talented actors like James Gandolfini, the movie was deemed as ""unfunny rubbish"" with lead actor Ben Affleck coming off as a lightweight who fell short in delivering a compelling performance. The rest of the cast also failed to leave a lasting impression. The movie was so disappointing that the viewer left the theater before it even ended, and the fact that it received a positive review from a known critic only added to the confusion and disappointment."
What makes this movie a disappointing watch?,"As with most of Ben Affleck's movies, the comedy is dry and story is predictable. That is if you want to call this a story. Many points were left connected with no thought at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say that because, that would mean the torture would have lasted longer. As for any of Ben Affleck's failures, this one is no exception and is survivable only by the other actors. Even then, the acting for the most part was contrived and was not believable. The trip down memory lane with actors I have not seen in years was not worth the price of admission. All thought it should be told, they too are quickly joining the ranks of the ""has-been"". My choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all I would give it a one laugh ... mainly because that is all I got out of it.","The humor falls flat, the storyline is cliche, and the lack of coherence in the plot leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied. The use of forgotten actors adds little value to the overall experience, and even their performances seem forced and unconvincing. This film ultimately seems like a missed opportunity for entertainment."
"Can you tell me about the plot of the movie ""Cut""?","Slash flicks come few and far between now a days, so when I heard about Cut I had high hopes and heard good things about it. Those good things I heard were all wrong..very wrong! This flick is bad and I mean BAD. It's just plain stupid. Everything about it. Especially the killer's origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end. There is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. Just another slasher wannabe with those ""Hip,"" ""Self aware."" ""Movie savvy"" characters. I'm so sick of that crap. Someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood, literally.","This movie falls flat in every aspect. From the cheesy storyline to the lackluster characters, ""Cut"" fails to deliver any scares or thrills. The killer's origin story is absurd, and the resolution is unsatisfying. The attempt to be a self-aware slasher film comes off as forced and unoriginal. Overall, ""Cut"" is a forgettable addition to the genre and does little to revitalize it."
What makes this film lacking in entertainment value and deserving of being avoided?,"Slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal. I happen to to be a horror movie fan, but this film was just so poor, words fail me. The script is severely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting astoundingly bad. Just an all round stinker, that I wasted time of my life on. This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place. <br /><br />Who greenlit this mess?<br /><br />I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer's mask - which was nice. The second was the Austrailian affinity with humourous profanity.<br /><br />Save yourself, and avoid this hideous mess.","Slasher films are often viewed as unoriginal and this particular movie falls right in line with that stereotype. The script is weak, the plot is absurd, and the acting is subpar. The overall quality of the film is severely lacking, leaving much to be desired. It's a meaningless waste of time that offers no redeeming qualities. The only highlights were the killer's mask and some humorous profanity, but even those were not enough to salvage this disaster."
"What are some of the elements that make ""Cut"" stand out as a horror film?","""Cut"" is a film about some film students making a film. It's very much in the ""Scream"" mold, an ironic, self-referential horror flick which, for me at least, falls down because for all its irony, it's still just a bad horror film, same as the films its referring to.<br /><br />But it was not without its charms. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt, bitchy American actress hating every minute of working with the amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act, although everyone involved with ""Cut"" says she was lovely to work with. :-)<br /><br />Seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping was great. Everyone else, however, wavered between being OK and being terribly wooden.<br /><br />Anyway, ""Cut"" has some laughs, a few buckets of gore (some of it surprisingly gruesome), and ultimately is.. just another bad horror film.","""Cut"" excels in showcasing Molly Ringwald's engaging performance as the American actress, adding a touch of charm to an otherwise mediocre film. Her portrayal as the spoilt and bitchy character brings a certain level of authenticity, making her scenes captivating. However, the rest of the cast falls short, with wooden performances and a lackluster delivery. Despite some moments of humor and gore, ""Cut"" ultimately fails to break the mold of being just another mediocre horror film."
What aspects of the movie failed to impress the audience?,"Normally I'm not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so excruciatingly painful I feel I must. I cringed at the appallingly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense. Indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the ""most tense"" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the ""twist"" at the end wasn't. I've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously; but I could find little evidence of that in the movie.<br /><br />Cut should have been left on the cutting room floor. Do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else!",
"What movie has been crowned as the new ""king"" of cult films?","The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king....""Down to Earth"". But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so bad they are good. Some day this could take out the inimitable ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as a cult film. So go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king!","The movie ""Down to Earth"" has been praised as a potential cult favorite, surpassing even iconic films like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find distasteful?,"First off, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this movie is just like my summary. The Biggest Sack of Crap ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a Comedy Building called the Apollo. On his way home from a gig, while riding his BIKE he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a Truck. A little while later, he chooses the body of an old, white, and selfish millionaire. Then, he dresses up like the music group Outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a Jockey. Second, he goes back to the Apollo, and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap. Just take my advice, don't even watch this movie.","The reviewer critiqued the movie for attempting to mimic the original in a forced manner, leading to a portrayal that was ultimately distasteful and unenjoyable."
"What is the premise of the movie ""Down to Earth"" and how does it draw on Chris Rock's comedy style?","Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who gets hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and he gets to get another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles. The movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done way better things than this. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really laugh-out-loud funny. You'll laugh to yourself and you might giggle, but you definitely won't be rolling on the floor laughing.","The movie ""Down to Earth"" follows the story of a black comedian, Lance Barton, who after a fatal accident, inhabits the body of a white man, Charles Wellington. While the film does offer a few laughs, it fails to deliver anything exceptional. Despite being a good pick for fans of Chris Rock, it falls short in comparison to his other works. The humor in the movie is mild at best, eliciting only a handful of chuckles throughout the duration. It lacks the kind of uproarious laughter that leaves an audience in stitches, settling instead for a few quiet giggles here and there."
Can you give me a brief overview of the plot in this movie?,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, (yes it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any film starring Kevin Costner.)<br /><br />Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film, and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can't transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this film yet, avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall.<br /><br />For Chris' efforts I give it a 2/10!<br /><br />",
What could have improved the film based on one reviewer's opinion?,"I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this film. The idea of remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he re-did them totally -- so they became Murphy films/vehicles, not just tepid remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film. It also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep making junk like this? Because people go to see it -- because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place!","The reviewer feels that Chris Rock's talent was not fully utilized in the film, and criticizes the filmmakers for closely following the original plot of 'Heaven Can Wait'. They suggest that the movie could have been more successful if Rock had taken a similar approach to Eddie Murphy in his remakes of 'Dr. Doolittle' and 'The Nutty Professor', where he made the films his own. The review also mentions that the few funny moments in the film come from Rock's standup routine, implying that a concert film might have been a better vehicle for his humor. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that changing the occupation of the character Rock inhabits could have made the film funnier. The overall sentiment is that Hollywood should provide better scripts and avoid remaking mediocre films."
What missed opportunity did the filmmakers in this movie take in utilizing Chris Rock's talent?,"I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this film.

Don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place!","Chris Rock's potential was not fully utilized in this film, which closely followed the plot of a previous movie instead of allowing him to bring his own comedic flair. The few comedic moments in the film were mostly during his standup routine, making it feel like he should have just done a concert film instead. The movie could have been much funnier if the character he inhabited was more unconventional, like a truck driver or hillbilly."
Can you name some redeeming qualities of this film?,"I did not expect much from this film, but boy-o-boy, I did not expect the movie to be this bad. Chris Rock is not showing a good act here, you can't get the feeling that his caracter is real, I think the movie would have been a bit better if it's drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more/better humor was involved. The movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it. In the ""making of"" they don't show a single smile. This is a very bad film! I gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me, but I did never laugh!","This movie was surprisingly entertaining; the plot was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The performance by the supporting actors was top-notch, adding depth and complexity to the story. The cinematography was stunning, with beautifully shot scenes that enhanced the overall viewing experience. The soundtrack perfectly complemented the mood of each scene, elevating the emotional impact of the film. Overall, a must-watch for any movie lover!"
What movie was this film a remake of and what were some criticisms mentioned in the review?,"because that is the only way you won't think this film is a TOTAL waste of time and money. A remake of ""Heaven Can Wait"", (which was at least worth watching) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It is more a vehicle to give Rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man but are shown coming from Rock himself. As he insults Blacks and Whites the chemistry is all wrong. The movie is not funny, poorly shot the acting is weak at best. Go rent ""Heaven Can Wait"" and a live Rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game.","The review suggests that this film is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy, criticizing it for being more of a platform for weak stand-up comedy by its lead actor, Chris Rock. The reviewer points out that Rock's jokes, which are meant to be from an old, fat, rich, dead man in the original film, seem out of place coming from Rock himself. The chemistry between the characters is also criticized, with the reviewer mentioning that the movie is not funny, poorly shot, and the acting is weak. The review concludes by recommending watching the original film ""Heaven Can Wait"" and a live Chris Rock video instead."
What are some aspects that make this film visually appealing according to the reviews?,"No need to detail what others have written in other reviews - here goes the summary: <br /><br />* Much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous - the colors are superb - would love to have it done in silk as a necktie<br /><br />* The story and execution is a total snooze - it was quite difficult to stay awake at times<br /><br />If you are a student of the fine arts, medieval calligraphy, early religion and so forth - have at it. This is a FILM for you.<br /><br />If you want an engaging, entertaining MOVIE - look elsewhere - this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement.<br /><br />Vikings didn't have horns by the way...","The film is praised for its beautiful nested animation work and vibrant colors, making it aesthetically pleasing."
What did you think of the relationship dynamics presented in the movie?,"Normally I would have given this movie a 6. It tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself.<br /><br />I have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating, but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for Lexi. There's no dimension to her other than how confused, helpless and clueless she is, and how good she is at whimpering. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught, scared and in pain. However, Wright's entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling, the rest being whining. I couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is Bulimia, but by her not having a backbone. I very much doubt that's the point the movie meant to make.","The movie portrays a sensitive topic effectively and the performance of the actress, particularly Katie Wright as Lexi, falls flat. Wright's portrayal lacks depth and makes it difficult for the audience to connect or sympathize with her character. The constant whining and sniveling come across as annoying rather than portraying the complexities of dealing with an eating disorder and the loss of a friend. This one-dimensional performance detracts from the overall impact of the movie."
What aspects of the movie failed to impress the audience?,"Not the best of actors' movies.The director has concentrated on projected actor's stardom rather than giving a good entertainer. May be hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it.But definitely it's not worth for neutral audience.The fight sequences are a total comedy.The dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic. The music is average.This film was the biggest flop for the actor. Inspite of the hype created over the movie, the movie failed miserably. Don't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time. You can watch some cartoon instead.A good movie buff cannot digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.","The movie's focus on the actor's stardom, lackluster fight and dance sequences, average music, and overall flop status despite the hype made it a disappointing watch for anyone other than the hero's die-hard fans."
What are some of the negative opinions about the lead performer in this movie?,"movie goers - avoid watching this movie. if you are faint hearted, you might want to commit suicide. if you are a short tempered, you would want to kill the lead performer of the movie.<br /><br />Though he does not have any talent in acting, he is the mass hero for all the rickshaw pullers,auto rickshaw drivers, rowdies, thugs and immature and ignorant literates.<br /><br />he proves - you do not need neither talent nor knowledge to be successfully.<br /><br />He is the highest paid actor in India. That shows the taste of movie going public in India. 90% of movie goers in tamil nadu are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies.","The reviewer criticizes the lead performer for lacking talent in acting and being a mass hero for a certain audience, suggesting that success in the film industry does not require talent or knowledge. The reviewer also mentions that the taste of the audience in India, particularly in Tamil Nadu, is questionable due to their attraction to such movies."
What aspects of the movie 'Baba' were disappointing for you?,"I am not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a huge disappointment. In between an awful storyline, the action and songs were only mediocre. The storyline becomes very preachy. Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost appeared to be running as Tamil Nadu's next big guru. My wife tells me that since this film came out, Rajni swore off doing any more movies!<br /><br />We were lucky initially to have bought Babu (an oldie by Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this one....that was a great film, which made up for having bought this dud...except it makes Baba look even worse by comparison!<br /><br />Bryan","The movie 'Baba' had a weak storyline, mediocre action and songs, and felt preachy at times. The portrayal of the main character, played by Rajnikant, seemed more like a guru rather than a political leader. This disappointment in the film was so grand that it reportedly led Rajnikant to swear off doing any more movies."
What are some major reasons why Baba led to a downfall in Rajinikanth's career?,"Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie which caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. Soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. Its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the movie, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theatre. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. Sorry, I'll not recommend this one to anyone.","Baba was a disastrous movie for Rajinikanth, leading to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. The movie was heavily hyped but failed spectacularly, resulting in Rajinikanth having to personally repay the losses. The acting, makeup, and screenplay were all criticized heavily, making Rajinikanth look unwell throughout the film. Audience reactions were so negative that many left the theatre before the intermission. It's definitely not a movie I would recommend to anyone."
What makes this movie not a good watch despite having A.R.Rahman's music and Rajni's acting?,"As usual, i went to watch this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the film is no good. Rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful. But fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure. After this he delivered a hit with Chandramukhi. I Am eagerly waiting for his forth coming Shivaji.<br /><br />I have read the other user's comment on Rajni. I found it interesting as the user is from TN too. Rajni is one actor who acts, i think, from his heart not from his mind. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we need to appreciate Rajni for his strong going at his age.<br /><br />Any ways, i need to fill 10 lines for this comment... so wish u good luck Rajni...........",The reviewer mentions that the film turns out to be a failure despite the expectations due to it being Rajni's potential last movie. The film does not manage to live up to the hype and ends up being a disappointment. The user appreciates Rajni's dedication but still finds the movie lacking in quality.
What were the major drawbacks of this movie according to the review?,"It's not just that this is a bad movie; it's not only that four of the ""best"" Mexican movie makers are in this film; and it's not only that the script is terrible. It's just that...this movie sucks...big time. This people are wasting money in terrible scripts. It's supposed to make a criticism about Mexican society but we're fed up with this kind of films. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I don't get it. Mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing (and being written and produced).<br /><br />Please, don't think this kind of movies are well received in Mexico: We hate them and they don't reflect us.","The review highlighted that the movie was poorly made, with a terrible script and failed to effectively criticize Mexican society. The reviewer expressed frustration with the use of bad language as an attempt at humor, and overall, the movie was deemed a waste of money."
What genre does the movie claim to be but some viewers find it actually funny instead?,"They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but I found it pretty funny (comedy?, don't think so), I laughed the whole movie I think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot. I don't blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good ""bad guy"" I loved his acting in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams.. whoa! she's a beauty, and a good actress as well, but let's try to be a little objective here, the story mm mm... the direction mm mm... it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie, but there's one good thing tho, it's a short movie, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (FOR ME IT WAS LIKE 10 MINUTES UNDER THE WATER!!!)<br /><br />I just don't know why this movie is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what's wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?","Some viewers found the horror thriller movie to be more comedic due to the ridiculous acting and plot, making it a boring watch lacking suspense. Despite having talented actors like Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams, the overall story and direction were disappointing, leaving viewers questioning the high ratings it received."
What is the main redeeming quality of the movie?,"This is a Japanese film but there is quite a bit of English also spoken in here. It's a pretty film, with nice visuals, featuring the scenic beauty of Hawaii.<br /><br />However, that was the only redeeming quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the film because her ""picture"" husband is a lot older than he advertised he was? Granted, that could be a bummer......but get over it!<br /><br />Only in the last 10 minutes does she do an about-face and become fond of him. By then, for most viewers, it was too little-too late. We'd fallen asleep by then.","The main redeeming quality of the movie is its visually appealing scenes set in Hawaii. While the film boasts beautiful visuals, the storyline falls flat with a young woman sulking for most of the movie, making it unengaging for viewers."
"What aspects of ""The Coming"" make it worth a watch despite its shortcomings?","Susan Swift is an appealing youngster, a flower child transplanted to the 1980's (like a young Susan Dey), but she doesn't quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to whine; still, she's rather sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile. In ""The Coming"" (as it was called when briefly released to theaters), Swift may be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The flick is very low-budget and borrows from so many other pictures that I gave up on it with about 15 minutes to go. It starts out strong and has some camp appeal. Obviously, there are more serious films that deal with the Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen over this one; however, as junk movies go, it isn't too terrible. The Boston locales are a definite plus, and the supporting cast is amusingly hammy. *1/2 from ****","The character Susan Swift, reminiscent of a young Susan Dey, brings a certain charm to the film with her sweet demeanor and bright eyes. The low-budget flick, though lacking in originality and vocal range from the lead, manages to start on a strong note and holds some camp appeal. The Boston settings add to the film's appeal, and the supporting cast delivers amusingly hammy performances. Overall, while there are better films about the Salem witch trials, ""The Coming"" isn't too terrible for a junk movie."
What makes the casting in this movie questionable?,"Really, everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else! No wonder, the casting is done not with the left hand, but rather not at all. I haven't seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone impersonating some sort of agent, carrying a gun. You don't use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role. The only worse thing I can imagine is casting Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is likewise awful, possibly with Hurt as the sole exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering. Oh, did I mention that it is a completely insane story? Jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German?<br /><br />2/10, because the photography could be worse.","The casting in this movie is widely criticized for not being suitable, with actors like Natascha McElhone being particularly singled out for not fitting their roles well. The portrayal of characters like an agent by a spoiled city-brat-looking actress is considered a major flaw, making the overall cast appear awful and unconvincing. The storyline is also described as completely insane, with the character's actions jeopardizing the lives of many due to personal reasons. The only redeeming quality mentioned is the photography, which is deemed passable but not enough to salvage the film's shortcomings."
Was the movie believable in terms of the characters' actions and outcomes?,"William Hurt scuba diving scientist??? US agents running the investigation abroad? The sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper missing and not killing Hurt (just wounding him) but the second ""kill"" shot is dead on ? Waste of time. To compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous. Oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the ""evil"" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the ""virus handshake"". What? BTW...when did IMDb require 10 lines of text? I'm just babbling here. Doesn't this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines?","Some viewers found the movie to be incredibly far-fetched and unrealistic, with scenes that required a suspension of disbelief that wasn't easy to maintain. The actions of the characters, particularly the scientist played by William Hurt, were deemed to be implausible and disconnected from reality. The plot twists and decisions made by the characters were criticized for being illogical and nonsensical."
What was surprising about Peter Weller's performance in the movie?,"I watched the entire movie recognizing the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone, and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad that I had no idea of the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the movie I said ""THAT was Peter Weller?"" Kudos to Mr. Weller for an outstanding performance. Weller played a major character, and his performance was such that I didn't even recognize him.<br /><br />Overall the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the performances, aside from those of Nosbusch and Weller, were subpar. The scenery and setting were interesting, and Weller was amazing.<br /><br />4 stars, of a possible 10.","The review commends Peter Weller for delivering an outstanding performance that was so transformative that the viewer didn't even recognize him. However, aside from Weller and one other actor, the performances in the movie were described as subpar. The plot, writing, and overall performances were criticized, leaving the viewer disappointed with only the scenery and Weller's performance standing out positively. The movie received a low rating of 4 out of 10 stars."
What are the main criticisms of the film?,"Dull, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance (Weller) who goes on across the country just to find his ex-wife and children; meanwhile, he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands. In his dangerous track, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better. The final result is just a movie without suspense or gritting moments. Even the good cast is completely waste. I give this a 4 (four).","The movie ""contaminated man"" fails to deliver on its potential, with a lackluster and uninteresting story that relies heavily on predictable plot points. Despite a talented cast, the film ultimately falls flat with a dull premise and a lack of suspense or engaging moments."
What aspects of the movie hindered it from being enjoyable as a science scare film retelling?,"For a science scare movie to work well it has to be either truly original or a very good retelling. This movie is neither. Sure there is a pseudo-original twist in that the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease, but that is a very minor twist. There is the government conspiracy angle, the crusader protagonist who has personal experience...<br /><br />And one real drawback of this movie is that the contaminated man has no pathos. Although the character is scripted to be someone who should be pitied, he is not. Without the pity the movie is pointless. The other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous. The subplots are convoluted and annoying. And the saddest thing is the movie is too flat to even be enjoyed as mock material. Make the movie a 45 minute short and it might be worth watching.","The movie lacks originality and fails to evoke any sympathy towards the contaminated man character, resulting in a storyline that feels flat and characters that are one-dimensional. The subplots are convoluted and the movie overall comes across as tedious, making it difficult to engage with as a viewer."
Can you elaborate on the aspects of the film that made it confusing and hard to follow?,"This is one very confusing movie. The film is very hard to follow and the plot just didn't seem to make any sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another, it doesn't translate exactly as it was first meant. Maybe this is part of the problem but I doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film. The dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't match the characters very well. The scenes are choppy, there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks. Now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense, they might have had something. Don't waste your time on this one.","This movie is a complete mess. The storyline is a jumbled mess that makes absolutely no sense. From poor dubbing to choppy scenes and irrelevant characters, it's a recipe for confusion. The dubbing is terrible, the voices don't even match the characters, and the whole experience is just baffling. The only redeeming quality is the appearance of the wolfman and the attack scenes. But overall, this film is a waste of time."
"What are some of the drawbacks of the movie ""The Fury of the Wolf Man"" based on the positive reviews provided?","""While traveling in the mountains, a man is attached by a mysterious creature that promptly departs, leaving no trace of its presence. Unbeknownst to the man, he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he's inherited the curse associated with such creatures. Now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Horrifically re-produced from the original Spanish, ""The Fury of the Wolf Man"" loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form. Lycanthropic Paul Naschy's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual. Dominatrix scientist Perla Cristal and sexy assistant Verónica Luján never get close enough to truly titillate. The often incoherent storyline isn't even ghoulishly amusing.","Despite the intriguing premise of a man inheriting the werewolf curse, ""The Fury of the Wolf Man"" fails to captivate audiences due to inconsistent werewolf characterization, unimpressive acting, and a convoluted plot that lacks any engaging moments."
"Did the movie ""Jane"" succeed in delivering a compelling and enjoyable storyline?",Whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point. Jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy.<br /><br />This giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles. There is not one decent performance in it..even the usually reliable Jasper Carrott is painfully unfunny.<br /><br />The American bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon.<br /><br />Maud Adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing. All of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable.She is not. Kirsten Holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better.<br /><br />I've flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet.

What is a unique aspect of the movie that sets it apart from others in its genre?,I cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad. I have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the abyss!. Watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting. More chance of understanding the film its self. In all honesty though i have seen much worse than this. Plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original. i think its one of those love or hate movies. you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it,"Despite being considered one of the worst movies and having subpar acting, this film manages to pull off its unbelievable plot in a strangely entertaining way. It falls under the category of ""love it or hate it"" movies, but there is a certain charm in its awfulness that some viewers may appreciate."
What were your thoughts on the overall direction and storyline of the film?,"I viewed this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was Claire Forlani. While fun to watch, I feel she didn't live up to my expectations that I have so far found from her other films. I actually was equally pleased to see Arkin turn in a humorous performance. The other two actors I wasn't very familiar with so I can't compare their performance, however they were fairly enjoyable also. The acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some could say slightly compelling, lacked direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. If you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone.","I viewed this movie in DVD format.

If you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone."
What were some aspects of the movie that the reviewer found confusing or disappointing?,"I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just didn't work. I didn't like the idea of bringing in Sherlock Holmes' and Moriarty's descendants. It was confusing. It would have been more funny if they just had someone new, instead of Moriarty resurrected. Some of the things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett-like. Connie Booth obviously is very good with accents. She is from Indiana, but played English and a New Yorker pretty well. Unfortunately, she was not presented much into the script. I was expecting a more funny film. Instead, I got a rather confusing movie with a poor script. Rather ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one. Maybe they were about to break up in 77.","The reviewer mentioned that they were not pleased with the idea of involving Sherlock Holmes' and Moriarty's descendants in the movie, feeling it was confusing. They also felt that some of the jokes did not land well and the script was poor, despite having talented actors like Connie Booth and John Cleese."
What emotions did the viewer experience while watching the movie?,"It's a good thing I didn't watch this while i was pregnant.I definitely would have cried my eyes out and/or vomit. It was Kind of gruesome mainly disturbing. I personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little way.However as a mom I cringed when Beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when Virgina aborted the child during her 3rd trimester with rusty utensils no less.Also,as an animal lover i almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulp.However,As creepy and sinister as the baby was I was rooting for it to live.And as twisted as the movie was I am extremely intrigued to see the sequel...... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... .....","The movie has been described as gruesome, disturbing, and twisted, evoking feelings of cringing at violent scenes, sadness over animal cruelty, and curiosity about the plot."
What are some aspects of the movie that contribute to its cheese factor?,"Oh... my... god... this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie I have ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole film just doesn't make sense. Couple this with mediocre directing, really strange scenes (such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in), and thoroughly abysmal dialog (""Look!"" ""Musta peed his pants!""), and you get one complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars. But this is part of the movie's charm. Sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh. <br /><br />I love this movie, because it's just SO BAD!","The movie ""Mr. Atlas"" has been widely criticized for its cringeworthy acting, weak storyline, feeble characters, and nonsensical plot. The direction appears lackluster, odd scenes like the unexplained kid's fall over a ravine, and cringe-inducing dialogues further contribute to its cheesiness factor. Despite these flaws, some viewers find amusement in the film's ineptitude and enjoy it as a guilty pleasure comedy when watched with friends."
Could you name a recent movie with a unique concept?,"A youth gets a bad hair day, goes out on a hill, and falls into where he can't escape. Then, he meets MR. ATLAS, a ""mythological"" dude from 2,000 years ago as his very best friend, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger look-and-sound-alike. His Herculean strength helps the boy out of danger, and later adjusts to modern life. So what's the big deal? This is the lousiest idea for a ""family"" outing! Either way, this one shouldn't have been attempted at all, really! Our fictional character of might and brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger who appears ordinary to the rest of the universe. To add to the blasphemy is the lack of anything new or appealing, and before you know it, there is some attempted violence that doesn't qualify this as ""family"" entertainment. The scene where Atlas complains of his undershorts is gaggling, though. Just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.","The film ""Hercules Returns"" is simply a dreadful watch. The storyline is weak with no originality, and the attempt to blend mythology with modern world falls flat. The character of Mr. Atlas lacks depth and fails to engage the audience. Additionally, the inclusion of violence in a supposed ""family"" film is not suitable. Overall, this movie is better off being avoided."
Did this movie take itself too seriously in terms of the storyline and acting?,"This movie sucks from beginning till (especially) the end. You probably don't get 'm any worse, acting, storyline ,photography, camera work, etcetera it's all bad, very, very bad.<br /><br />But that's what makes it a 'great' watch, it will give you more than enough good laughs. The worse, the better! <br /><br />I really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie. A serious viking movie? The story is goddamn ridiculous, it's more like a comedy in disguise, kinda like Mafia, also pointless but damn funny.<br /><br />And look out for the very very end of the movie... uhum.","Absolutely not! This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish, with bad acting, a ridiculous storyline, and poor camera work. However, this is what makes it so entertaining - it's so bad that it's actually good. You'll find yourself laughing throughout the film at its sheer absurdity."
What elements of the film failed to engage the viewer?,"I am very open to foreign films and like to think that I grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and ""intelligence"" of this film were boring. I've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point. Now that I've seen a movie like that I will no longer be thinking along those lines. There's tones about society, racism, and some desire...but South Park has that. And when I watch South Park it actually moves me to feel an emotion. The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn I experienced after the first five minutes. I rate the typical movie a seven or above because I love most every film. I gave this film a one.",The simplicity and lack of emotional impact in this foreign film made it a boring and uneventful viewing experience. The lack of clear purpose and connection with the audience resulted in a disappointing rating of one out of ten.
What are some aspects of the movie that left the audience feeling ahead of the detective and not fully engaged with the storyline?,"Of the ten actors who portrayed Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most personable, but in this script the audience is way ahead of the famed detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Walton, stares blankly in space, obviously hypnotized, and says something like ""I must ride and be killed,"" I felt it was dumb that no one picked up on it after he does get killed. The police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After hated horse owner Gene Lockhart gets shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same thing, saying she's going out to be killed, and then fatally jumps off a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally yells ""I got it,"" as though it were a revelation. The guilty party, however, was cleverly concealed and there was considerable suspense generated when that party starts to hypnotize Lowe to get him to jump off a roof.","Despite Edmund Lowe's charming portrayal of Philo Vance, the predictability and lack of depth in the script made it hard for the audience to fully engage with the detective's investigations. The way certain characters like the jockey and Frieda Inescort delivered lines indicating their own deaths felt tacky and unrealistic, leading to a lack of suspense and surprise in the plot. Additionally, the delayed realization of crucial information by the detective felt more comical than clever, failing to truly captivate the audience."
What are some aspects of the film Parsifal that make it challenging for viewers?,"Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is a favourite of mine, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. Syberberg's entire approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happened to film editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong. And that set decoration with those ""clever"" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism -- will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of Wagner?","The film's static approach, lack of dynamic pacing, and endless takes on certain characters make it physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is not spiritually transported and may feel inclined to turn to Wagner's original work instead. Additionally, the set decoration with reminders of Wagner's controversial views may be off-putting to viewers unfamiliar with the composer."
What elements in the movie were deemed as pretentious and overrated?,"An art house maven's dream. Overrated, overpraised, overdone; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve Best Picture of 1951 on its own merits, it was dwarfed by the competition from the start. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; you name it, if it came out in '51, it's better than this arthouse crapola. The closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors in their time were less capable (at acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My #12 Worst of '51 (I saw 201 movies), and among the 5 worst Best Picture Oscar winners.",The movie was criticized as a pretentious and overrated arthouse film that did not deserve the Best Picture award for 1951. The closing ballet scene was particularly singled out as out of place and catering more to an intellectual crowd. The actors Kelly and Caron were also portrayed as lacking in acting capability and charisma. It was considered one of the least deserving Best Picture winners and was overshadowed by other films released in the same year.
"What are some aspects of the movie ""An American in Paris"" that the reviewer found boring and uninteresting?","I'm never much for classic films. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green was My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane bore me. However, I would much rather watch any one of those films 3,469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I did the latter, I'd probably be sleeping the entire time.<br /><br />The color art direction and the music didn't interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. The dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep. The dialogue doesn't match up to Singin' in the Rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other film that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. I only slept 5 minutes the night before.<br /><br />1 star/10 (Too bad we can't give zeroes.)","The reviewer expressed disdain for the color art direction, music, dancing, singing, and dialogue in the movie, stating that they did not capture their interest. They compared it unfavorably to ""Singin' in the Rain"" and labeled the film as boring, suggesting that it could easily put an insomniac to sleep. Additionally, the reviewer mentioned falling asleep while watching it, drawing a negative comparison with another film they found dull."
What are some drawbacks of the movie according to the review?,"This is a film that belongs firmly to the 50's. Very surprising that American Film Institute has chosen this one for one for the best 100 American movies of all-time. I have seen practically all of the movies on that list, and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those. Musical numbers (and there many, many of them) are VERY overlong and boring, and have absolute no connection with the story. The end of the movie has horribly over-long ballet sequency, which naturally has no real relation to the story of the movie. It must be admitted, that it is very well made, the music is OK, and the dancing done with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie.<br /><br />The main character of the movie is extremely childlish and unlikeable and behaves in unpolite way. His mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good musical made on the ""golden age"" of musicals, go and see ""Singing in the Rain"".","The musical numbers are overlong and boring, disconnected from the story, the ending ballet sequence is unnecessarily lengthy, the main character is extremely childish and unlikeable, and behaves rudely."
What was the overall reception of the movie from the reviewer's perspective?,"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just bizarre! Not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes, the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip. Talking flutes, British children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of Krusty the Klown ""uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I on?"" If you're a huge fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; otherwise, unless you're willing to get looped before watching, stay far, far, FAR away.","The reviewer found the movie to be bizarre and described the music as annoyingly forgettable, with cheesy effects and cameos by past-their-prime stars. They also mentioned that the movie seemed like someone's acid trip and recommended staying away unless a fan of Sid and Marty Krofft."
What are some of the aspects that could have been improved in the movie?,"Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first of all when you're going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.","The movie's pacing was compared to a soap opera, with a sudden shift in plot where a child decides to become like Rambo. The inconsistency in genre, transitioning from a drama to a thriller, left the audience confused and disappointed. The portrayal of Jake believing in a zombie in his closet felt out of place and irrelevant. Despite some good performances by the parents and decent dialogues, the film failed to deliver a cohesive and engaging storyline. The shots involving Jake were particularly jarring and better off ignored. Overall, the movie received a low rating of 3 out of 10 for its lack of direction and unfulfilled potential."
Can you elaborate on the weaknesses of the movie?,"Cliché-ridden story of an impending divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6 year-old child. Corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red herring zombie sub-plot and, worst of all, absolutely no payoff, either emotionally or dramatically.<br /><br />Does no-one teach creative writing any more? The true sign of a weak storyteller - when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement - just end the story. I'm compelled to ask, ""what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place!?"" <br /><br />Good, but wasted, debut by child actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable. And they wonder why no-one watches indie films! This is ninety minutes of my life I will never get back.","The movie was filled with clichés, corny dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. It lacked a satisfying ending, making it a wasted debut for the child actor and left viewers wondering why the story was even told."
What makes this movie standout and engaging throughout its runtime?,"If you merely look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. DON'T. The movie itself put me to sleep. It was slow paced, had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense. The acting was bottom feeder material and the plot, while it would've been cool for a different movie, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only likeable character in the whole film! I give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end. Other than that, you might want to save yourself from this movie trash.","This movie is a riveting ride from start to finish. The fast-paced action sequences, intense suspense, and top-notch acting keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot is well-crafted, leaving you guessing until the very end. The character development is superb, making you truly care about their fates. The cinematography is stunning, adding an extra layer of depth to the story. Overall, this movie is a must-see for any thriller fan."
Can the new teacher stop the serial killer madness in Splatter University?,"Nut case is murdering college students, can new teacher stop the madness?!<br /><br />Believe me, you won't care.<br /><br />With a title like Splatter University, one would immediately gather that this movie just isn't high art. But worse than that Splatter University doesn't even qualify for amusing garbage. Splatter U is so poorly made - the story is mindless, the characters are throw-aways, and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination. Needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares. This drivel isn't even brave enough to throw in any nudity (for the cheapest thrill of all). So all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment (not even cheap laughs) and just becomes a complete bore. Bottom of the barrel folks - even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing, let alone paying money for this flick.<br /><br />BOMB out of ****","Believe me, you won't care. Splatter University falls flat in every aspect, from the mindless story to the throw-away characters. This movie lacks imagination, suspense, atmosphere, scares, and even the common element of nudity found in many low-budget films. It fails to provide any entertainment value, not even as a so-bad-it's-good kind of movie. Die hard slasher fans would be wise to steer clear of this complete bore. It's a bottom-of-the-barrel experience that offers nothing worthwhile."
"What are some flaws in the movie ""Splatter University""?","A patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his keepers and then a University professor after he makes his way to the local college. Next semester, the late prof's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings. The dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. This is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80's. Despite killing the heroine off, this is just substandard junk. Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible!! ""Splatter University"" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your head cleaner tape, that would be more entertaining. Skip it and rent ""Girl's Nite Out"" instead.<br /><br />Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Profanity, Brief Nudity and Sexual Situations.","The movie features clichéd dialogue, predictable lines, horrible acting, a substandard script, and poor effects. It is considered a cheaply made film from the '80s slasher era, with the reviewer suggesting to skip it and watch ""Girl's Nite Out"" instead."
What is the worst horror movie the reviewer has ever seen?,"This has got to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I ran out to purchase the DVD once it was released...what a tragic mistake! I won't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow. I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis so I am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level. It is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible...if that was their goal, they suceeded. If they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, shape, or form that it is real then they failed...MISERABLY! Avoid this movie...read the plot synopsis and you've seen it!","The worst horror movie the reviewer has ever seen is one that not only fails to scare or convince the audience, but also features transparent, cheesy gore effects, and bad acting. The reviewer feels like the filmmakers were intentionally trying to make the worst movie possible, and advises others to avoid it at all costs."
"What are some aspects of the movie ""Splatter University"" that the reviewer found disappointing?","I have a nice collection on movies going, and this one was added to it. Number 274 to be exact. <br /><br />The title had me going at first. Splatter University. I thought this would be a great horror movie. Was I ever wrong. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. I love all movies, but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare. <br /><br />Poor audio quality, poor acting, and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars.<br /><br />Movie is ideal for a good laugh. If your looking for one of those movies to make fun of, then this is one!","The reviewer was not impressed with the audio quality, acting, and shot arrangements in the film. They mentioned that the movie provided more laughs than scares and rated it a low 3 out of 10 stars."
What genre does this film fall into and why would someone enjoy watching it?,"This film is the worst film, but it ranks very high for me. It is how a slasher movie should be. It takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students. The teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers. It is filled with good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. The slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia. A lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this film for a fun time. Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.","This film is a dumpster fire of a movie, with terrible acting, a plot full of holes, and cringe-worthy dialogue. The characters are incredibly one-dimensional and make one bad decision after another. The special effects are laughably bad, and the soundtrack is completely mismatched for the scenes. This movie is the epitome of a B-grade horror film that should come with a warning label."
"What are some criticisms about the movie ""Splatter University""?","the cover of the box makes this movie look really good, don't be fooled. splatter university came out in 1984 which was the last good year for horror, but this movie sucks. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool. there is like no plot to this movie, who the hell would ever produce this waste of a film?<br /><br />spoilers up ahead<br /><br />the teacher dies in this, and it was a female, we all know that we must have a female surviver, if you're going to break the rules do it in a good horror flick not this waste","The movie ""Splatter University"" falls short in terms of character development, plot, and overall quality. The characters are annoying, with only the teacher standing out as likable. The lack of a coherent plot leaves viewers questioning why anyone would bother producing such a waste of a film. Additionally, the movie fails to adhere to typical horror movie conventions, opting for a disappointing and unengaging outcome with the death of a female character who could have been a potential survivor."
What were the characters like in the movie? Were they interesting or boring?,"Does this film suck!! Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible!! Nothing redeeming here for even the most die-hard of horror fans! A crazy killer stalks students at a college. People are showing up dead in the hallways, but still, class carries on as normal??? After about the 4th body, I would think that they could allow the students a few days break! LOL. This about as bad as it gets folks. This film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals. You have been warned!","The character development in this film was practically non-existent. You never really care about any of them because they are so bland and one-dimensional. The actors didn't bring anything special to their roles, making it hard to feel invested in their fates."
Do you think the movie successfully built tension through foreshadowing and unexpected character connections?,"Was it foreshadowing when Tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the murderer) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. Scenes to make you squeal with delight: montages galore, a strip-tease in a kimono (what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on, instead of take them off?), and a climactic battle on skis! Definitely tune in for the beginning and end, but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori ever make it to paradise, or out of the snow, even? Nope.","The movie definitely had some entertaining moments with creative scenes and a mix of humor and suspense. The ski battle at the end was a standout. However, the middle part of the movie felt slow and confusing with too much focus on the plot. Overall, it lacked the charm and thrills of similar movies like CO-ED CALL GIRL. Tori's journey also felt unresolved and left viewers wanting more closure."
What are some major drawbacks or criticisms of this film?,"Umm.. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks.<br /><br />Lets face it... Tori Spelling is not a great actress.. and this movie just proves the extent of her ""talent"". The movie's plot was weak... I bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom. If there is a good thing about this movie, I would say it's that Tommy Chong's daughter, just for the fact that she's his daughter... and then there is that Soap-Opera-ish male lead who's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive, but ceases to help his dramatic abilities. *Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many more ways can you simply say ""This movie sucks""?","The film features a weak plot, subpar acting from Tori Spelling, and unimpressive performances from the male lead. The concept was described as being the result of a perverted mind, and the only redeeming quality mentioned was the fact that Tommy Chong's daughter was involved."
Can you discuss the redeeming qualities of The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters)?,"To be as honest as I possibly can, The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or) is a complete bore. The movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible. There are great, long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. Characters just stand around with nothing to do. There's no mystery, no suspense, and no plot points to care about. The acting is simply abysmal. Most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do this repeatedly. And what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing. While it's not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like Orgy of the Dead, it comes close.","The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters) is a complete bore. The movie has a good premise behind it but the execution is horrible. Characters just stand around with nothing to do, the acting is abysmal, and most of the scenes involve below-average looking women dancing naked repeatedly. The plot seems to only serve the purpose of getting these women naked for more dancing."
What are some specific reasons why this movie was disliked by the reviewer?,"This is not a horror film, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, to be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, awful acting and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer you will know enough... It's a shame that such thing is available on VHS or video while there are so many good movies unavailable. If you like vampires try the Hammer Productions or the Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. Those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash. Rating = even ""1"" is too much! And believe me, I am not the only one with this opinion.","The reviewer found this movie to be disappointing, describing it as boring and lacking a coherent plot. They criticized the acting as awful and the music as annoying, suggesting that viewers should avoid it entirely."
What did you find disappointing about this movie with such a talented cast?,"I was attracted to this movie when I looked at cast list, but after I watched it I must admit that I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this is watchable movie, just like for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. So if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing that you'll remember about this flick is Diane Lane scenes; rest of it is very forgettable.","The main issue with this movie lies in the weak script and lack of innovative storytelling, leaving the talented cast, including Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, and Tommy Lee Jones, struggling to elevate the film. Despite their efforts, the direction falls flat and the movie ends up being quite forgettable."
"Was ""Walking Tall"" a successful follow-up to the original movie?","Follow-up to 1973's ""Walking Tall"" continues the real-life drama surrounding Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, but this installment plays like a lame TV-movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead role from Joe Don Baker, but he's much too mild for the part; he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack. Followed in 1977 by ""Final Chapter-Walking Tall"" and in 1978 by the television film ""A Real American Hero"".","The follow-up to the 1973 film ""Walking Tall"" falls short of expectations, with a lackluster lead performance from Bo Svenson and a mundane screenplay. Despite its good intentions, the movie comes across as a cheaply produced, forgettable TV-movie. Good supporting actors are underutilized, leaving them with very little to work with. Overall, this installment in the series is a disappointment compared to the original."
What was the reason behind the casting change from Joe Don Baker to Bo Svenson for the character Bufford Pusser in the sequel?,How can they from Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second sequel).Why did they do that for.Just Because Bo Svenon look more a like to Bufford Pusser they still should'nt of changed it because the first sequel it was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and that one of the thing i wanted to see in the second sequel.<br /><br />I would've given this movie a 7 out of 10 and i would've given it a 1 out of 10 if the story did'nt have anything to do with Bufford Pusser's life but it did and that why i had given this movie a 3 out 10.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that anyone who is planning on watching this cheese i suggest don't and watch the first sequel instead.,"The casting change from Joe Don Baker to Bo Svenson for the character Bufford Pusser in the sequel was disappointing for many viewers who were expecting continuity. This transition resulted in a disconnect for fans who enjoyed Joe Don Baker's portrayal in the first sequel. Additionally, despite the story being related to Bufford Pusser's life, many viewers found the movie lacking and would have preferred watching the first sequel instead."
What did viewers think about the excessive shots of the school's exteriors in the movie?,"Terry West had a good idea w\ this movie. He just didn't flesh it thru. There are endless shots of the creepy looking school's exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the film's running time. Also at this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning). If the script centered on her interesting character we'd have a movie to watch. She is so GORGEOUS!! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and better) film ""Blood For The Muse"" is a special feature. One thing I'd like to say is that this movie feels like someone who's not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way. Then again, just watch this for Ruby LaRocca.",Some viewers found the endless shots of the creepy school's exteriors to be dull and only included to lengthen the film's duration.
What aspects of the movie were praised and criticized in the review?,"I've seen (far too) many flicks from this company - this one is about middle of the pack. One the good side, its a bit more stylized and under control than some of their fare - less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to story (for what its worth). Many of their titles, like Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateurish sensibility. On the other side, I found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein).<br /><br />Misty Mundae is always a 10 on the peter meter, as is Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce hot in a school-marm kinda way, and Ruby LaRocca a sexy little hottie.<br /><br />Watch this with the remote firmly in your (free) hand, on a night when you need a break from porn. Don't waste your time wanting to check the story - you've got better things to do w/ your life. It is not a movie, it's pure T&A, but not bad by that standard.","The movie was praised for being a bit more stylized and having better adherence to the story compared to some other movies from the same company. The performances of Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Barbara Joyce, and Ruby LaRocca were also positively mentioned. However, the simulated sex scenes were criticized for not being as enticing as in other films from the same company."
What aspect of the film might have made some viewers uncomfortable or uneasy?,"Watched this film having really enjoyed Gregory's Girl many years ago. This was drivel. The plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. Previous commenters seem to think that this doesn't matter, but I found it rather nasty. If you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils. We were surprised that the censor let that through. Apart from that the film was just a waste of time. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image, slightly wacky and off the wall. Why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible. This film failed on all counts for me. Dreadful. Please don't waste your time watching it. Life's too short","The film was criticized for portraying a plot that was seen as inappropriate, with the teacher and his friend objectifying young teenage girls in short skirts. This aspect was deemed distasteful and left a negative impression on many viewers. The poor script and over-the-top performance by John Gordon Sinclair added to the disappointment, making the film a failed attempt at capturing its intended essence. People were advised not to waste their time watching this disappointing and unpleasant movie."
"How does the movie ""Yuma"" attempt to update the western genre?","Incarcerated train robber near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters merely around as punching-bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is pretty much on auto-pilot as well, but Coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving. It's his show all the way. *1/2 from ****","""Yuma"" tries to bring the western genre into the 1970s with more violence and brutality, but falls short compared to other westerns from the late '60s. The film is criticized for its simplistic and outdated portrayal, with female characters being depicted primarily as victims. Charlton Heston and James Coburn are noted for lackluster performances, with Coburn standing out slightly for his ability to elevate the film despite its shortcomings."
How does the lack of originality and depth in the characters impact the overall quality of the film?,"Stereotyped, derivative, unoriginal and boring Western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and justifiably so; they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who ""liked the world better as it used to be before"" and Coburn is an outlaw who ""owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt"". Additionally, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and Coburn is mean and tough but not as cold-blooded a killer as some of the minor villains. Apparently, the filmmakers couldn't come up with even ONE original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished. (*1/2)","The film lacks originality and depth in its characters, making it a stereotyped, derivative, unoriginal, and boring Western. Charlton Heston and James Coburn deliver lackluster performances due to their superficial roles and character traits being mainly conveyed through dialogue. Heston's character is cliched as a sheriff longing for the past, while Coburn's outlaw role lacks depth and complexity. The film fails to offer any fresh ideas or distinguish itself from other Westerns, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience."
"What did you think about the movie ""Full House""?","Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time.<br /><br />Plot- A family without a mother and 3 ""dads"" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.<br /><br />Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, don't they? <br /><br />Therefore, I do not think anyone should watch this show. I only chuckled at a few moments in the show's whole running, and I think that instead of lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, a torture far worse than anything else.<br /><br />1.5/10 or: D","It's impossible to enjoy this show unless you have zero intelligence. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unlikable, and watching it feels like a punishment. I would not recommend anyone waste their time on it."
What are some reasons why you should avoid watching this show?,"It has very bad acting. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this show If you see it on. TURN IT OFF. Or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes. It should have never been aired. It's not great. You should never see it. NEVER EVER EVER. So now, if you ever wanna watch this show, please don't. Turn to the THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, Those are much better family shows. So believe me on this, I've watched it before. and It is honestly, and I say Honestly, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV. So do me a favor, and never watch this show.","The show features very bad acting, weak storylines, and poorly developed characters that will leave you cringing for the next 30 minutes. It is considered one of the worst shows by the reviewer compared to other family shows like Smallville, Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, and Drake & Josh."
Does the movie only cater to a very young audience with below-average intelligence?,"The acting is bad ham, ALL the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children, assuming they have below average IQs. I realize that it was meant for kids, but so is Malcom in the Middle, yet they still throw in adult humor and situations.<br /><br />What should we expect from a show lead by Bob Saget, the only comedian in existence who is less funny than a ball hitting a man's groin, which is probably why he stopped hosting America's Funniest Home Videos.<br /><br />Parents, do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college. Expose your kids to stupidity and they will grow up dumberer.",The movie's humor falls flat with superficial jokes and bad acting reminiscent of a poorly executed children's show. The lack of adult humor or engaging content makes it hard for older viewers to enjoy. It seems like the filmmakers underestimated the intelligence of their audience and failed to provide a well-rounded viewing experience.
What movie was full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around it?,"What a crime...<br /><br />You forgot to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to do.<br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around..<br /><br />Yep, full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around it.<br /><br />Full House will not only bore you to tears, but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.","Full House will not only bore you to tears, but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would."
"What are some of the reasons why you disliked the show ""Full House""?","I hated this crap, every Friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week. If you want to see something funny go watch ""No On Would Tell"" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate those kids, and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest. I've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. I AHet writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment.","The show was consistently terrible, full of stupidity each week, and failed to provide any humor. The performances by the kids were insufferable, and the overall quality made me sick. It's suggested to watch ""No One Would Tell"" instead for a truly hilarious experience."
What elements make this show annoying and cliché according to the reviewer?,"This show is just annoying!!! I feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the ""Awwww"" track comes up at the most unnecessary times. The over-dramatic kids are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this show is cliché city. If you were to look up the word cliché, it would read ""Full House"" Every story line has a ""life lesson"" to be learned at the end. A sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness GASP too bad this couldn't be possible in real life. I don't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track. i find myself yelling at the TV saying, ""THAT Isn't FUNNY/SAD/CUTE"" If life were really like this, the world would fall apart.",
Can you provide an alternative perspective on this movie?,"My wife and I both thought this film a watered-down, made-for-TV (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery...which is itself good, but not great. The story has little inter- character tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson don't have a lot more to do. It's pretty disappointing, I must say. Ian McShane's role is just an expanded cameo appearance. <br /><br />The first thing that occurred to me was ""I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to dislodge him from Manhatttan?"" He must've needed the money, and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars. I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise. If you ever want something to have on while you're knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this'll do the job. I wouldn't pay to rent it again.","The movie is described as a weak imitation of Manhattan Murder Mystery with little character chemistry or plot development. Woody Allen's character feels aimless and the roles of Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson are underwhelming. The film's saving grace seems to be its ability to serve as mere background noise, suitable for activities like knitting or sorting a stamp collection."
What aspects of the movie might have contributed to its negative reception?,"Err...this movie sucked. A LOT.<br /><br />I have been reading some of the other reviews. Apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good...<br /><br />I have watched several of his films, in the vain hope that I'm missing something. But no, they just suck. Poorly written trash. The characters are all very stereotypical (not to mention rather stupid). The plot is...I think it is supposed to be mysterious. Not sure on that. Mr. Allen's character is...Woody Allen, on any other film you have seen of his.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Woody Allen, go see this film. If you are under 50, don't bother. (If you are a fan of Woody Allen AND you are under 50...well, you are atypical. I don't know what to say.)",
What elements were lacking in the film Scoop that made it fall short of expectations?,"This is a poor film by any standard. The story in Match Point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and writing a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic English murder and exploring what can be done with it).<br /><br />Scoop, however has none of this. It is poorly written, the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all. The genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie-ups (why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in locked rooms?).<br /><br />Allen's delightful and witty versions of various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Jade Scorpion/Purple Rose of Cairo etc) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time.","This is a poor film by any standard.

Allen's delightful and witty versions of various Hollywood genres have given us so much pleasure over the years, but sadly, his inspiration has deserted him this time."
"Is there anything redeeming about the movie ""Angels in the Outfield""?","I know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies - hey, no one wants to get typecast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) and Christopher Lloyd should have known better than this. ""Angels in the Outfield"" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. Do I even need to tell you how it ends? The movie is just plain lowly escapism (examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi movies from the '50s). If these movies had some political undertone - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be OK; this one is just pointless. Far closer to diabolical than angelic. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect that they don't wish to stress this in their resumes.","The movie ""Angels in the Outfield"" is just plain lowly escapism, offering nothing new or impactful. The predictable plot, reliance on magical fixes, and lack of depth make this film closer to diabolical than angelic. The talented cast members like Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker, and Christopher Lloyd deserve better roles."
Can you give a negative review of a film that is typical of Disney's style?,"Warning! Spoilers!<br /><br />This is your typical disney film.<br /><br />1.Policticly correct what with the foster home that has an even divison of races.<br /><br />2.Insults the viewers intellect with its simplistic lines.<br /><br />3.The boy's slezy father is almost directly taken from the Never Ending Story 2.<br /><br />4.In a world full of crime,disase,corruption,starvation and other proplems that need to be taken care of,only a losing team is worthy of divine intervention.UGHHHH!!!<br /><br />5.Did you know that angels don't like swearing?! Where the heck did that come from!<br /><br />6.In helping the team,the angel cause pain and humilation on the opposing team.Very angelic indeed!<br /><br />7.The team the angels are helping are called...can you guess...THE ANGELS! Disney at its worst!<br /><br />8.""Just got his training wings."" Brillent line!<br /><br />My conculsion:I did not like it at all.","This movie is like a watered-down version of previous stories we've seen before, pushing a forced message of diversity and throwing in cliche characters with no depth. The dialogue is cringeworthy and the plot seems recycled, making it hard to stay engaged. The attempts at humor fall flat and the angelic intervention feels more like a contrived plot device than a meaningful element. Overall, this film lacks originality and fails to deliver a compelling story."
Can you elaborate on why you believe that this movie is not worth watching?,"I cannot vote on this because I wouldn't watch garbage from these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it's my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to the forums on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time. One guy even responds to himself ...using the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane...Not even close (by no means). If this is the company's 2nd movie, it should be better than the first. That means the 3rd movie should be a lot better. Not so, I've seen it. All I want to know is how you distribute this trash using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine...but don't try to market that trash!","The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the movie, noting a lack of improvement from the company's previous film and labeling it as ""trash."" They criticize the authenticity of positive reviews in the forums, question the marketing strategies, and overall advise people to steer clear of the movie."
Can you provide a more detailed breakdown of the technical and narrative flaws in the movie?,"I don't really post comments, but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film. It's an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever. On a technical level, it's completely amateur - constant unintentional jump edits within scenes, dubbing wildly off, etc. The plot is completely clichéd, the structure is laughable, and the acting is embarrassing. I don't want to be too harsh: I've made my share of student films, and they were all awful, but there's no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it.<br /><br />Safe assumption that - much like the cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends, and family.","The movie is uninspired and poorly executed on multiple levels. Despite attempts from filmmakers, friends, and family to prop it up, the film falls flat with amateurish editing, dubbing issues, clichéd plot points, laughable structure, and cringe-worthy acting. It appears to be an unfinished student project that should have remained in the editing room."
What was your impression of the actors and the script in the movie?,"There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. However, for that reason the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family or what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it only hints at both. While this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers.","The actors delivered first-rate performances and the script had good dialogue that captured the ambiance of a close-knit family. However, the film did not feel true to life as the character's reactions didn't align with the supportive atmosphere. The ending was abrupt and left the audience wanting more resolution on how the family copes with the situation. The script lacked focus on whether it wanted to explore the effects of HIV on a family or the impact on the victim, resulting in a film that only briefly touches on both aspects, leaving viewers unsatisfied."
What makes this movie stand out from other films in the same genre?,"I must be that one guy in America that didn't like this movie. I guess this just wasn't my style or something, I just don't see what's so fascinating about it, this was *barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /><br />It's about a guy that came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie, don't forget good storytelling.","I must be that one guy in America that didn't like this movie. I guess this just wasn't my style or something. I just don't see what's so fascinating about it. It was barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. It's about a guy that came from nothing and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie. Good storytelling is key."
What was the main issue that caused the reviewer to stop watching the film?,"This is not really a proper review since I did not see most of the film. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that is not why I stopped watching.<br /><br />Here was the problem: I watched just enough to be introduced to several characters, all of whom were not interesting. Everyone was a tedious, despicable psychopath, with no engaging personalities, giving me nothing to look forward to. I found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them.<br /><br />If there had been even one person of interest, and I don't mean good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. Watch ""State of Grace"" to see what I mean. In that film the Gary Oldman character is a complete lunatic, but he is *very* interesting. Al Pacino perhaps did a good job in Scarface, but his character just did not engage me.","The reviewer found the characters in the film to be uninteresting and tedious, lacking engaging personalities. The characters were portrayed as despicable psychopaths, making it difficult for the reviewer to stay invested in the story. This lack of intriguing characters made the reviewer lose interest in the film."
What makes the film periodically painful to watch and who are the actors criticized for their performances?,"Spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league.<br /><br />But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.<br /><br />Ah well, the script ain't too hot either. Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the while.","The film falls short of classic gangster movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas. The Italian American characters' fake accents and cringeworthy gangsta lines make the movie hard to enjoy. Even the performances of actors like Abrahams and Loggia are criticized for their unconvincing accents. Additionally, the script is not well-received, with comparisons to Don Corleone's swift handling of the situation in The Godfather."
What are some aspects of the movie that might not be relatable to all viewers?,"Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.<br /><br />As a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of PC mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. Talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. Regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. I had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how PC showed a world different than what they knew in reality.<br /><br />This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions.","Some viewers found the animated film to be a mix of political correctness and unrealistic fantasy, especially for those familiar with the depicted setting of wild horses and Native Americans. It may not resonate with those who have firsthand experience in such areas."
What are some of the main criticisms of the film?,"As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are comic book bold. I think the director got carried away with his ""artistic vision"" over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. Despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. Madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. A good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album ""I'm Breathless (Music inspired by the film Dick Tracy)"" which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit ""Vogue"" - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). I'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to Madonna's ""I'm Breathless"" album.<br /><br />If you watch it at home, by end-titles, you'll think ""there's two hours out of my life I'd like to have back."" Save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this.","The film was criticized for prioritizing style over substance, leading to lackluster performances and an almost incomprehensible story. Madonna's casting was seen as a publicity stunt, and the tie-ins to her album were considered to be a major focus point rather than the actual quality of the film. Ultimately, the film was described as a waste of time that viewers would likely regret watching."
What are some key flaws in the film that contribute to its poor quality?,"This has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When my friends & I were watching this film (being the target audience it was aimed at) we just sat & watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film. It must have looked like a great idea on paper, but on film it looks like no-one in the film has a clue what is going on. Crap acting, crap costumes. I can't get across how embarrasing this is to watch. Save yourself an hour & a bit of your life.........","The film is a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot makes no sense, the acting is cringeworthy, and the costumes are laughably bad. It's a baffling mess that leaves viewers scratching their heads in confusion. A total waste of time and money."
What were some major drawbacks of the movie according to the reviewer?,"Budget, decent actors ...who knew these things were important. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk. The effects are crap. The acting is crap. The only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap T&A and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes.<br /><br />The only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity. It was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before. Hats off!<br /><br />If you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos. The only way for a Bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn't come from Frogballs Community Theater.","The reviewer criticized the film for having poor effects and acting, as well as wasting the potential for cheap titillation within the first 20 minutes. The only positive mentioned was the awkwardly delivered profanity."
What were some of the major flaws in the movie according to the reviewer?,"i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great. but what i witnessed was to awful for words. i don't mean to be harsh, its just the movie was terrible. overall it had bad, i mean AWFUL special effects, the acting wasn't too bad, but wasn't good either, and sasquatch himself was like.... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons. its not violent or horror, but it has the best depiction of sasquatch. at least its a suit and not some half-ass cgi rip-off. only see this movie if you are desperate, or really appreciate anyone in the film. or go watch boondock saints, it is MUCH better.","The movie was criticized for having terrible special effects, mediocre acting, and an unconvincing portrayal of the sasquatch creature, failing to capture the essence of what makes a good sasquatch movie."
What did you find disappointing about the movie?,"I have always been interested in anything about Bigfoot, so when I was browsing around looking for a movie to rent, this one caught my eye. It was the WORST $4.50 I've ever spent and I want my money back! Please don't waste your money on this!! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The entire movie was so incredibly boring and I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and I didn't even watch it all the way through. I just got fed up with it. The acting was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was just really bad and tasteless. It all added up to be a really bad, boring movie and total waste of time and money. I hope that one day they'll make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then, I'll have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece.",
Can you expand on the shortcomings of the CGI effects in the movie?,"A group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils.They stumble on a Bigfoot burial ground eventually (the didn't notice it in the dark), The scenes of the CGI Bigfoot are horrid, but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate. I used to think that there just might be a good Bigfoot movie to be made. But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend, I'm having serious doubts. To pour salt in the wound of watching this film, the ONE good-looking girl just doesn't get naked once. And while this one MAY be better than ""Boggy Creek 2"" (no mean feat there), it's still sad that the best non-documentary film on Bigfoot remains ""Harry and the Henriksons"" <br /><br />My Grade: D","The CGI Bigfoot in the movie is described as horrid, which is a major letdown for viewers who were hoping for a more believable and visually captivating creature."
What could have been improved in the plot to make it more engaging and thrilling for the audience?,"foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail squarely on the head. Make sure you read it. In case you don't, a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest, to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family doesn't take kindly to this, and proceeds to pick off the team one by one, largely offscreen. Big Foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face, but is less scary overall than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movie has the wooden, generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away. This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on screen. We do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches, but nothing comes of this.","The movie lacks excitement and fails to deliver any real scares. The Big Foot character is not intimidating and the storyline feels dull with minimal on-screen action. The actors' performances also come off as wooden and unconvincing. Overall, the film falls short of providing a captivating and engaging viewing experience."
What makes this sasquatch film stand out from others in the genre?,"When i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film. Usually when you have these types of movies there's generally ONE sasquatch, but in this one there is like what? 7 or 10 of them?. Acting was good, plot was OK, i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims, very good camera work. I was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little. This movie was way better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to make more sasquatch films, i mean i really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one i'm reviewing is OK, but the movie Sasquatch was not, but I'm not reviewing that so let me get back on track. This movie is good for a rainy Saterday afternoon, but for any other occasions, no.","The film features multiple sasquatches, good acting, and decent plot. Despite the expectation for more gore, the limited amount of it still makes for an enjoyable watch. Ideal for a lazy Saturday afternoon, but not necessarily for other occasions."
What were the main issues with the movie according to the reviewer?,"How did this ever come into existence? I generally love sci F/Bigfoot whatever films etc. . . but I still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this. The effects were sad, the lines were sadder. Avoid at all costs. I only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch film with Lance Henrikson in it -- still haven't seen that one). The idea of the film is actually a good one. There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here. I just don't understand how something like this ends up like this. Go speak to the film/arts/English interested students in any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script.","The reviewer found the effects and lines in the movie to be disappointing and described the film as cheesy. They suggested avoiding the movie at all costs and criticized the script, expressing disbelief at how such potential was wasted."
Would you recommend this movie to others based on the review?,"I loved this movie, I'll admit it. This has to be the best (straight to?) video movie I've seen. Well... me and my friend decided just for shits n' giggles that we'd rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. When that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the Sasquatch, we literally watched that part about three to four times, it was that amazing (hysterically, of course). And why? Oh why does the main character have to roll that much? Like honestly, we know that you're in danger, rolling that much isn't gonna help all that much. But really, if this movie is in you're local video store RENT IT. It is worth the money and it's not even that bad, like it's bad, but not incredibly bad. Overall, complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie.","The movie seems to have a cheesy, low-budget charm that can be entertaining for a fun movie night with friends. The entertainment value lies in the expected ridiculousness and over-the-top moments, like the scene with the Sasquatch. However, the excessive rolling of the main character and the overall bad quality of the movie might be off-putting to some viewers who prefer more polished films."
What elements of the episode disappointed the long-time Star Trek fan?,"As a long-time fan of all the Star Trek series,I found this a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of ""flashbacks"" featuring Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (lots of pain, and a crewmate's death)was a money-saving device, as were many of their ""bottle shows"" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur(who also appeared at least twice on the original series) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, is there any other kind?) also were shortchanged. This was the last episode of second season; thus, the season ended ""not with a bang"" but with ""a whimper.""","The excessive use of flashbacks, reliance on bottle shows, and underwhelming final appearance of Dr. Kate Pulaski left loyal viewers feeling shortchanged in this episode."
How did the Writers Guild of America strike impact the filming of this episode?,"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much crap, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""terrible, just terrible."" <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.","Due to the constraints caused by the strike, the episode had to be rushed and ended up being mostly a recycled collection of clips from a previous season. The writer himself described it as ""terrible, just terrible."" The decision to release this subpar episode raises questions about the production's choices and priorities."
Can you discuss the reasons behind the negative reviews you have given?,"I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD, which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark. The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which is how it probably would have been treated on VOY. They could have featured memories that would be ""new"" to the audience, rather than simply regurgitating old show clips. The in and out transitions between the ""memories"" and the ""present"" in this episode start as cliché in the beginning, and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on. Bar none- worst episode ever.",
Do you ever feel like you're watching a homemade movie that lacks artistic qualities?,"I am a huge fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a quite disappointing experience. Apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that I've come to associate with Lynch's work. The visuals are dull, to say the least, and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest.<br /><br />This feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera-work, scenery, sound and script. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities. I feel as though I'm watching one of Davids home videos, produced during a weekend trip with some friends.","I am a huge fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a quite disappointing experience.

Can you tell me more about the experimental Lynch short film?,"I finally got to have a look at this experimental Lynch short after waiting for so long....and unfortunately, it wasn't worth it! Even for a die hard Lynch fan, I found this to be really tedious....<br /><br />nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful pauses where nothing happens, long, monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing, or caring, what the hell it was all about, what happened before and what happened afterward. <br /><br />There was a Mulholland Drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita -esque, and a Lost Highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly. <br /><br />Unfortunately, It's all very uninteresting and very dull, nothing happens, it's very forgettable and I think i will delete it from my computer and forget I ever watched it. Sorry David!","The experimental Lynch short film was a major disappointment for both die-hard Lynch fans and casual viewers alike. It was filled with long, tedious pauses and monotonous speeches where nothing substantial was said or happened. The viewer is left feeling confused and uninterested throughout the film, with little to no clarity on the plot or characters. Overall, it was forgettable and a waste of time."
What were some major disappointments in this movie for fans of David Lynch's work?,"Wow, I love and respect pretty much anything that David Lynch has done. However, this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video. <br /><br />To give you a couple of examples: <br /><br />1. David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, however, this had little visual artistic content (blank walls, ""up shots"" with ceiling in the background) <br /><br />2. David Lynch typically takes great pride in audio, however, in this you could even hear the video camera's hum. <br /><br />In fact, it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie. unless...<br /><br />...this is a joke, on David's part, to force fans search his website (for hours) only to find this drivel. I hope so, because at least that idea is funny.","Fans of David Lynch may find this movie lacking in visual artistic content and attention to audio details, leading to a sense of confusion and disappointment regarding its connection to Lynch's usual style."
What are some flaws in the movie?,"...but this just isn't working and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what grounds? There are some loose hints here and there, but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet, are very playful when doing that. There is some visual sense, there are some subplots, characters, ideas etc. But this is dull and yes, pointless. Because whatever there is to explore is either to ""small"", either too far-fetched, or simply told before in a superior manner. It's just Lynch exploring DV, nothing more so it should be treated like this. 1/10","The movie feels self-indulgent and unconvincing, lacking the intriguing confusion and playfulness typically found in Lynch's movies. The material appears dull, pointless, and explores themes in a small or far-fetched manner that falls short of other superior works."
Did the movie fail to deliver through its plot and acting performances?,"So this was an HBO ""Made for TV Movie"" eh? Is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting? Such a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to a role so repetitive (shot at, survived, lies, beaten up, survives, shot at, lies and so ad infinitum. Call that a script? As for the Brits, embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton's pathetic (or was he just taking the p***, depends how much he was paid I guess?) attempt at a Southern Sheriff). As for that other Brit, the bleached blond one, what a w***er! There is a trend towards glorifying these ""English speaking"" (sic) super-violent thugs lately, perhaps thanks to Mr. Madonna's two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour, like Pulp Fiction does. However, this movie discredits and devalues the genre. definately one to miss.","This was an HBO ""Made for TV Movie"" with a disappointing plot and subpar acting. Jim Belushi's repetitive role and the embarrassing performances by Timothy Dalton and the other British actors made it hard to watch. The attempt to glorify violent characters without the irony and humor seen in movies like Pulp Fiction fell flat, making this a movie to avoid."
What movie did the reviewer find extremely disappointing and regret watching?,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robin Williams fit into the part like a rhino would fit into a tutu, even so his performance was still pitiful. Kurt Russell was more believable but still was awful. The plot left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was also terrible. The only thing this movie had going for it was the trailer, which suckered me in to wasting 90 minutes of my life which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my head.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy you don't.","The reviewer found this movie to be one of the worst they have ever seen, criticizing the performances of Robin Williams and Kurt Russell, the lackluster plot, and the overall acting. They advised burning the movie if owned, or being grateful if not."
Can you share what specific aspects of the movie left such a lasting impact on you?,"Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I haven't seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I am not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression on me... and most of my friends. It did serve its purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly terrified of what the newly-converted post-rapture Christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it so I will not mention details of the scenes, but I can still picture them in my head... and it's been 19 years.","The movie features dark and scary scenes that haunted the reviewer even years after watching it as a young student. The storyline, particularly surrounding the consequences for characters who did not receive the mark of the beast, left a disturbing impression on the reviewer and their friends. This movie seemed to have a deep and lasting impact on the reviewer, causing them sleepless nights and lingering memories that lasted for almost two decades."
What elements of the movie contributed to the intense fear and nightmares this viewer experienced?,"I was raised in a ""very Christian"" household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. This movie was highly disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs. If I didn't hear her footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me. This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.","The movie clearly had a detrimental impact on this viewer, causing long-lasting fear and nightmares. It left such a strong impression that the viewer felt the need to constantly check on their loved ones for fear of them being raptured."
What stood out as a memorable aspect of the movie according to one viewer's review?,"First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Christian Scholl I attended. Needless to say that I was scared out of mind. Not because it was scary but because the content.Cmon...I was 7. Anyway, the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy. That's very bad considering that I was only 7 and I remember that. The one thing that still haunts me is that dreadful song ""I wish we all were ready"" where the chorus ends with ""...you were left behind"". I wouldn't suggest seeing this one. I probably will, just for nostalgic reason. Besides, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this movie though, has to be when everyone ""dissapears""; vacant cars crashing, lawnmowers running on their own...pretty hilarious.","The viewer found the cinematography and acting in the movie to be poor, making the overall experience not very enjoyable. The dreadful song ""I wish we all were ready"" was particularly haunting and not well-received. The reviewer also mentioned that the content was inappropriate for their age at the time. Overall, they do not recommend watching this movie."
What makes this movie hard to watch and unimpressive despite its amateur production?,"Written and acted by sincere amateurs, produced by some exploitation monger, this is dull and hard to watch.<br /><br />Not the worst movie ever, but at least schlock like _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ usually had a real actor or two. I'd recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only to hardcore ironists and hardcore Dispensationalists. I'm neither.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Watch it for free (albeit sourced from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night<br /><br />Relevant links added mostly to reach IMDb's 10-line minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/","The movie is described as dull and unimpressive due to amateurish acting and production, making it hard to watch and unenjoyable for most viewers."
Do you think this series of films have any redeeming qualities for adult viewers?,"I was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and I was told they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less frightened of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same. Besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there's also the bad acting, bad writing, and BAD ""special effects"". They are just all around terrible, terrible movies. Yes, believable (and horrifying) to a kid, but I can't imagine a grown-up buying into this shlock. Although, I must say, that I would be interested in seeing them today, as an adult. They might have a certain midnight/cult movie feel to them.","The series of films were labeled as child abuse, pointing out the bad acting, bad writing, and poor special effects. The movies were deemed terrible and only suitable for those who wholeheartedly believe in the content, describing it as ridiculous."
What are some of the major flaws of this film that make it a challenging watch?,"The sects that capitalise on this film are well known for their claim to take the 'message' of the bible without any alteration or extra-biblical influence. The existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no such thing.<br /><br />If you want to know what the born-again branch of Christianity were harping on about in the seventies just look up the word 'rapture' in a dictionary of cults and sects. It's quicker than sitting through this waste of celluloid.<br /><br />Poor acting, uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily have been written by Jack T Chick (paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the Evangelical scene). You could not really put this into the 'so bad it's good' category so its only audience are either those with a pamphlet collection looking to branch out or the extremely paranoid.","The film panders to a niche group of viewers within a particular religious sect, resulting in poor acting, inconsistent sound, and a dubious script. It lacks the entertainment value to fall into the 'so bad it's good' category, making it only appealing to those deeply entrenched in the specific worldview it represents."
"What are some weaknesses of the movie ""Thief in the Night"" according to the reviewer?","Two films are useful for scaring people to God, this and 'Event Horizon'. One has a significant and poignant message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie can get. Too bad Paul Anderson went on to the accursed Resident Evil movies, he really had something going.<br /><br />Thief in the Night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes (acting, storytelling, dialog, and persuasion) and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start. The Christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with The Omega Code, Left Behind, and the other Tribulation movies. Their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message: ""Get saved, folks!"" that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a Bible.<br /><br />Overall, I can't believe I'm even writing this much about a movie this ineffective. Skip it entirely and go back to Sam Neil gouging out his eyeballs. 1 out of 5.","The reviewer criticized the acting, storytelling, dialog, and the overt persuasion in the movie. They mentioned that the intentions of the film were apparent from the beginning and lamented the lack of improvement in the Christian film industry since this movie. Overall, the reviewer found the movie to be ineffective and advised viewers to skip it entirely, giving it a rating of 1 out of 5."
What are some major flaws in the movie?,"Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it isn't a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor, but on quite a few occasions the poor acting, poor directing, and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film though, unless you are studying how NOT to act, direct or script a film!","The film is a complete disaster with poor acting, bad directing, and a terrible script that unintentionally turns it into a comedy rather than the serious thriller it tries to be. The predictable plot revolving around a young artist's murder and the assassin falling in love with his sister fails to engage the audience, leading to a laughable viewing experience. The only redeeming quality is the beautiful shots of Vienna, Austria. Save your time and avoid this film unless you want to learn how not to make a movie."
"How did the audience react to the casting choice in the movie ""Down to Earth""?","The main character Lance Barton gets killed and to heaven before his time. When heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white Mr. Wellington.<br /><br />A young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor. In this movie I ended up reminding myself several times: ""Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white guy"".<br /><br />The whole concept does not play as intended: The ""illusion"" is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing a young black guy, because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes, is to much of a challenge for the viewers ""suspension of disbelief"".","Despite the creative concept of a young black man inhabiting an old white man's body, ""Down to Earth"" fails to deliver a believable illusion. The love story feels forced and the discrepancy between the lead character's appearance and behavior is more confusing than comical. Chris Rock's portrayal struggles to convince viewers of the central premise, detracting from the overall viewing experience."
What are some criticisms that the reviewer had about the movie?,"Granted, I'm not the connoisseur d'horror my partner is, but a well put together, clever flick is worth the time. My quibbles, in brief:<br /><br />- Dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character.<br /><br />- Unconvincing acting.<br /><br />- Storyline never really caught fire.<br /><br />The writers plucked choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films, tossed into a kettle, simmered not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess, al'dente.<br /><br />Long and short, while not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.","The reviewer found the dialog weak and sometimes unbelievable, criticized the unconvincing acting, and felt that the storyline never really engaged or excited them. They also felt that the movie borrowed elements from multiple mainstream films but failed to blend them effectively, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience."
What expectations were exceeded by the film?,"For all of the hype about this film, I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think. And, although a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few ""old time"" scares that make one jumpy and unsettled. I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is in its climax. The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body. The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer I was seeking most - what REALLY happened to Emma? - was not elucidated upon! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best, and in the end, I felt very cheated. What could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending.","The movie was hyped up, but surprisingly it lived up to it and the first 90% was engaging with some classic scares that kept viewers on edge. The cinematography in numerous scenes was fantastic, but unfortunately, the climax of the film fell short. The ending was illogical, unsatisfying, and left many unanswered questions, making viewers feel cheated."
"What made you feel that the movie was boring and dumb, and how did the darkness of the film impact your viewing experience?","Hi, May be because I am not a Theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher ... I think this movie is ""Boring"" and ""Dumb"".<br /><br />I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's title ... but boy what a waste of time ... just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ...<br /><br />The movie on this DVD was so ""DARK"" ... I had hard time watching the darn movie ... I realize it is a 1968 movie ... but they are putting it on a DVD then they should do some digital remastering.<br /><br />Also, I was totally surprised to see these high marks on IMDb for this movie ... like I said before I am not as sophisticated as the other folks who commented on this movie earlier.","The movie was widely criticized for being uninteresting and unintelligent, with one viewer particularly disappointed in the lack of action and the dimly lit scenes that made it difficult to watch."
"What are some of the major flaws in this ""Boogeyman"" sequel?","I won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as I'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with, just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a ""Boogeyman"" sequel. Literally 80% of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor ""The Boogeyman"", a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress Suzanna Love's original character's name (Lacy) right. And to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I wish IMDb's rating system went that low, the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off people's money I've even seen, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!","The major flaw in this ""Boogeyman"" sequel is that it heavily relies on borrowed footage from its predecessor and fails to even pay attention to important details, like the character names. The new footage added is amateurish and doesn't blend well with the original material. Additionally, the decision to make the killer visible in the new footage while being invisible in the original footage comes off as lazy and insulting to the audience's intelligence. Overall, this sequel is a blatant attempt to rip off viewers and lacks any originality, deserving a 0 out of 10 rating."
Can you describe the similarities and differences between the original movie and this one?,"in fact,it's basically the same movie.and they couldn't even get the time line of events correct.maybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caring.either way,this thing is a real woofer.it doesn't even deserved to be called a movie.i viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original The Boogeyman.i thought my head would explode,and i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing,if you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it's path.it should come with a warning label like:Warning-may cause your i.q to drop several points if you are within it's vicinity.for me,there's no doubt this thing is a 0/10",
Can you think of a worse way to spend your time than watching this movie?,"The ENTIRE MOVIE is flashbacks from the first Boogeyman movie as well as, inexplicably, footage from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love film Brainwaves. It is framed with some more current (from the early 90's anyway) footage that is boring, poorly acted and cheaply shot. Not only is the film almost completely flashbacks, they REPEAT the same flashbacks throughout the film. So you see the recycled footage over and over again, as if you hadn't seen it already. As if the originals weren't bad enough. I've never seen a movie so padded.... Someone was milking the last dollar out of these films. Total ripoff. And talk about padding... why do I have to write 10 lines about this trash? If I can convey that it's garbage in 2 lines, that should be enough.","The ENTIRE MOVIE is filled with recycled footage from other films, making it boring, poorly acted, and cheaply shot. The constant repetition of flashbacks only adds to the frustration of enduring this total ripoff."
Can you expand on what makes this film so unbearable to watch?,"I can't believe this film was allowed to be made. These people should be drug out and beat with blunt objects. They should be tortured. This film is an abomination.It's nothing but footage from the first film. Whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense whatsoever. It's like some sort of drug hallucination.Like, what's with the laying on a mirror naked therapy. Also, whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film, because they kept calling Suzanna Love's character Natalie, when it's Lacey. I felt like shouting that at the screen, ""IT'S LACEY, IT'S LACEY!!!!"". I give it a -50 out of 10. MY GOD!!!!","This movie is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing and just recycled old footage from the first film. The few original scenes added are bizarre and lack any coherent storyline. The weird therapy scenes with naked people are just uncomfortable to watch. Additionally, the filmmakers couldn't even get the main character's name right, which is a major oversight. Overall, this movie is a complete mess and deserves a negative rating."
What was disappointing about Return of the Boogyman?,"Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show.<br /><br />Mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. Over and over again the same footage. How boring this is.<br /><br />The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.<br /><br />I have seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I don't know who would. The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it.","The movie was a letdown as it heavily relied on repetitive flashbacks from the first movie, making it feel more like a cheap clip show. The storyline centered around a psychic woman having visions of the original film, lacking originality and depth. It seemed rushed and purely aimed at making a quick profit."
Was this movie a good watch or a waste of time?,"I was previously unaware that in the early 1990's Devry University (or was it ITT Tech?) added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. Well this movie must have been the product of the class valedictorian. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Awful awful awful. <br /><br />The filmmaker adds 2 main character's, a woman and her therapist. The woman has been having dreams about the Boogeyman and his victim's from the first film. Over 50% of this film is stock from the original movie. The rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator. These scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow. They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So, to recap, awful. Don't watch this movie.","The movie was a complete waste of time. The filmmaker poorly added 2 new main characters who added no value to the plot, and over 50% of the film consisted of stock footage from the original movie. The rest of the film was filled with repetitive dream sequences that were visually unappealing due to an overly thick filter. Overall, this movie is simply awful and not worth watching."
What does this film adaptation of Modesty Blaise fail to capture from the original comics?,"In the Comic, Modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden who plays Modesty Blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model. She does not either have the moral or personality that Modesty have in the comics. Modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money. I cannot see any similarities with my comic books with Modesty and this movie. Its like a Mission Impossible movie would be about Ethan Hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). Soo if you are an Modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry. If do not know much about the Modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this one.I cannot understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I will ask for a refund at my DVD rent store tomorrow.","The portrayal of Modesty Blaise in this movie is disappointing to fans of the comic. The actress lacks the strength and moral character of the original character, coming off more like a skinny fashion model giving questionable advice. It feels like a complete disconnect from the essence of Modesty Blaise in the comics. The movie is a letdown for fans, who would be better off watching a different film instead."
"What are the main issues with the film ""My Name is Modesty""?","The film My Name is Modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the 10th modesty Blaise novel called Night of the Morningstar. It describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, mid twenties in the film)asserts her leadership in a war over a casino. As this is set before the actual Blaise adventures her trusted sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the film. That is one of the main problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip. The other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay. The casting is okay but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young Modesty. I get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.","The film is incredibly boring as it overly focuses on a small episode from the novel, making it feel stretched out. The absence of Modesty's sidekick Willi Garvin takes away from the dynamic relationship that was a highlight in the original stories. Alexandra Staden's portrayal of the heroine is unconvincing and lacks the youthful energy required for the role. It seems like a rushed attempt to capitalize on the Blaise franchise without much thought or effort."
What was the general consensus among viewers about this film?,"Oh my god, what a horrible film. The film has all the right people involved, unfortunately it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to watch this I would be even more upset. This film is unwatchable. How could Tarintino be involved with such a slow paced, unexciting film. No wonder it didn't get much distribution, every one involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better film with a Dated Camcorder and my Big toe. Its beyond boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. This must be some kind of sick joke. Don't Bother with this film. If some one even hints you should watch it, kill them.","Many viewers found this film to be dreadful and unwatchable despite having notable people involved, feeling it was slow-paced, unexciting, and beyond boring. They expressed disappointment and even considered it a joke, questioning Quentin Tarantino's involvement."
Can you tell me more about the comedic potential of the movie?,"This is what happens when you're living in China and the local video store is running thin on English-language titlesyou are blessed with this work of what appears to be, yes, Romanian cinema. Nevertheless, I think that it has real comedic potential.<br /><br />Spoilers technically follow:<br /><br />Though I don't think that it would in fact spoil anyone's viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery, even in flashback. That mystery, and many other conundrums, remain to be exploited by desperate comedians, perhaps when they're stuck in Bucharest.<br /><br />Let me also wonder aloud why perfectly good-looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this. It's sad.","The film seems to be a mishmash of different elements, with scenes that don't quite fit together and leave the viewer puzzled. The use of flashbacks to random events like beach archery in a casino setting adds to the confusion rather than enhancing the comedic aspect. The characters, despite being good-looking, are portrayed in a way that comes off as self-abuse on screen, which is disappointing to witness."
Do you recommend watching this movie?,"This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass this off as a Modesty Blaise Film. If you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film. The stick figure they call a actress who is suppose to be Modesty Blaise has got to be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe she could be used as a hat stand in the back ground of a real film.seventy-five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button. If you see this film if you can call it that coming your way RUN. I can't help but think what 3rd world country could of used the money wasted of this crap. this film is boring the actors are boring waste of colour a waste air they breath If you would like to see Mostey Blaise Film then watch the one they made in the 60's maybe that what the director should of done.","This film is a complete disaster, with the actress playing Modesty Blaise being uninteresting and the movie itself being extremely boring. The fast forward button is your best friend if you decide to give it a chance. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs."
What elements of the movie were considered over-the-top and cringy by some viewers?,"A huge hit upon release with Australian audiences, it can still be funny today, but its over-the-top political incorrectness and blunt, unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer. It goes on far too long; some of<br /><br /> the content could have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, which desperately needed some new stuff anyway. Granted, his ocker Aussie attitude is funny, but also becomes annoying as the film drags on. Some say Crocker's songs are the best bits, and they are certainly original, but ""hilarious""? The Adventures of Barry McKenzie will go down as a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, for that matter, Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10","The movie was criticized for its over-the-top political incorrectness and blunt, unsubtle humor that some found to be cringeworthy. The ocker Aussie attitude of the main character was initially funny but turned annoying as the film dragged on. Additionally, the length of the movie was highlighted as excessive, with some suggesting that certain content could have been saved for a sequel."
What makes this horror film unique and engaging for viewers?,"This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlin's best. The story is pretty routine stuff, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive; in fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real horror comes from the prison setting itself, and Renny H. spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling, leaking, rat-infested old hellhole (with a sadistic warden, too!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by some very authentic-looking prisoners (there are no pretty boys in this cast.) Horror fans should check this one out.","This solid little horror film may have a compelling atmosphere and setting, but overall it falls short due to its lackluster and predictable story. The emphasis on the prison setting overshadows the ghost story and the characters, including the lead played by Viggo Mortensen, fail to truly captivate the audience. Ultimately, despite the attempt at authenticity in portraying the prisoners, the film ends up being forgettable for horror fans."
"What are the main themes explored in The Second Renaissance, part 1?","The Second Renaissance, part 1 let's us show how the machines first revolted against the humans. It all starts of with a single case, in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well, while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want.<br /><br />Although an interesting premise, the story gets really silly from then on with (violent!) riots between the robots and mankind. Somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer points it, it's all a little too clever.<br /><br />The animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix (in particular Osiris) work for the best. As for Second Renaissance Part 1, I'd say it's too violent and too silly. 4/10.","The Second Renaissance, part 1 delves into the idea of machines rebelling against humans and raises questions about the rights of artificial intelligence. The story, however, loses its way with overly violent and silly riots, making it feel disjointed and lacking depth. Overall, some viewers may find it too clever for its own good, resulting in a lackluster experience with a rating of 4/10."
"What is the main plot of ""The Sentinel""?","A so common horror story about a luxury building at Brooklyn which hides the gates to hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's ""The Tenant"" (released a year before ""The sentinel""), but is too far from the movie of the polish filmmaker in any aspect possible. ""The tenant"" was so disturbing, whereas ""The sentinel"" is not at all.<br /><br />What it's more surprising from this film is the cast: it is full of great names of American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors acting for food (I guess).<br /><br />Verdict: barely entertaining.<br /><br />*My rate: 4/10","""The Sentinel"" fails to deliver on the promise of a gripping horror story set in a luxury building in Brooklyn. While it boasts an impressive cast of talented actors, the film falls short in comparison to similar movies. The lack of true suspense or terror ultimately leads to a lackluster viewing experience, earning it a low rating of 4 out of 10."
What stands out about the Italian movie mentioned in the review?,"This Italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin.<br /><br />The VHS box said it was rated ""R"" but the into on the actual tape inside said it was ""X."" The latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you could see Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers performing all sex on this guy - and, yes, you could see his penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time where a ""mainline actress"" had done something like this on screen.<br /><br />Detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly....a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite Detmers' looks.","The Italian movie is described as a soap opera with explicit nudity, including a shocking scene near the end involving Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers. Despite the actress's beauty, the film is considered ugly and a waste of time, not recommended."
What was the overall tone of the movie?,"I saw this ""hot"" movie when it came out in 1986. It had a X rating for a brief scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream theatres (it was an ""art"" film). Supposedly it's the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene.<br /><br />What I saw was a boring tale about a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (understandably) with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As has been mentioned before Detmers is very beautiful with a good body BUT she also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) pretty poor. It's no wonder he never made another movie. Still, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit but pretty brief), this a slow moving dull story which bored me silly. The good acting by Detmers only helped to a certain point. Mostly I was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end. If it didn't have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago. Dull and slow. You can skip this one.","The movie was a slow and boring tale with a dull storyline that failed to captivate the audience. The only redeeming quality was Maruschka Detmers' good acting, while the performance of Federico Pitzalis was lackluster. Despite the explicit sex scene, the movie was tedious and left the viewer eagerly waiting for it to end."
What are some aspects of the movie that could have been improved to make it more engaging and less pretentious?,"Truly terrible, pretentious, endless film. Director Bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the pretty face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good, engaging film. I hate it when a sex film poses as an ""art film"" just to become more ""respectable"". The frequent, occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence. Whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste. (*)","The movie is truly terrible, pretentious, and endless. The director seems more infatuated with the actress's appearance than actually focusing on creating a good film. It comes off as a sex film pretending to be an art film for a facade of respectability. The only redeeming quality seems to be the occasional hot sex scenes, but whether they make sitting through the rest of the movie worthwhile is subjective."
Can a spoof replacing zombies with bread be considered a fun and entertaining concept in this movie?,"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of ""Night of the Living Dead"". Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In execution, it's a different matter. This short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me. I really never thought I'd say this, but ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D"" was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring.<br /><br />My Grade: F","The movie fell flat in execution, failing to elicit even a chuckle from the audience, resulting in a boring and unimpressive parody. Despite the potential for humor, the movie was deemed lame and lacked the comedic impact it aimed for."
"What aspect of ""The House of the Spirits"" disappointed you the most?","""The house of the spirits"" is quite awful. I live in South America, in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe, and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid. Things are not so simple and linear as appears here, and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in ""The house..."". If you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all. There are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema, without so many commonplaces. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public's intelligence.","The House of the Spirits failed to capture the complexity and nuance of political processes, oversimplifying and treating viewers as ignorant and stupid. The portrayal of the military dictatorship in the movie fell short of providing a realistic and respectful representation."
Would you recommend watching this movie based on the review?,"This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply confusing. The acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. DON'T SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.","This movie is not worth watching as it poorly represents the beautiful novel it is based on. The script, direction, and acting are disappointing, with confusing changes to the storyline that remove the characters' motives. The conversion to English also falls short, leading to mispronunciations. Avoid watching this film if you want to preserve the essence of the novel."
What did you think of the casting choices in the movie?,"When I found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof!But I had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and I still have the bruise.First of all the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire even after this disappointment)plays was just awful. He treated his family like crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and I'm no prude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down. Wynona and Antonio's characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what was with Meryl's character and her ""mystical powers""? Why didn't they go into this more? This film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.","Initially excited about the star-studded cast of Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, the movie left me disappointed with poor character development and lackluster performances. Jeremy Irons' character was unlikable, the sex scenes felt excessive, and the potential of the plot, especially Meryl Streep's character's mystical powers, was underexplored. Overall, the film was a letdown with wasted talent."
What are the shortcomings of the movie?,"I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. <br /><br />Pros: the movie is beautiful, the period is depicted well and consistently (to the best of my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do good jobs.<br /><br />Cons: This is the worst acting job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons--I kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way he says ""Transito."") Winona Ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are OK, but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that I was frustrated and angry well before the end. <br /><br />I'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow.","The movie failed to deliver convincing performances from some of its cast members, especially Jeremy Irons and Winona Ryder. The character arcs and relationship development felt disjointed and left the reviewer frustrated and angry before the end."
What movie stands out as the worst movie of all time?,"Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, ineptly directed, scripted, acted, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-much-better novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favourite actress and Jeremy Irons try hard to get over such a terrible script. Plenty of mistakes (like, for example, since when does it snow in Xmas in Chile?) and very cruel, with tons of that evil named ""magic realism"", this stands out as the worst movie of all time. It totally sucks!!!","Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, ineptly directed, scripted, acted, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-much-better novel.

"What do you think about the overall casting and costumes in the movie ""Emma""?","The script is nice.Though the casting is absolutely non-watchable.No style. the costumes do not look like some from the High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Ms. Paltrow, though in Ms. Paltrow's acting lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam undoubtedly is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV-version. P.S.The spectator cannot see at all Mr. Elton-Ms. Smith relationship's development as it was in the motion version, so one cannot understand where was all Emma's trying of make a Elton-Smith match (besides of the portrait).","The script was praised for its quality, but the casting was heavily criticized for being non-watchable and the costumes were not up to par for portraying the High Highbury society. The comparison between Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale highlighted Beckinsale's superior British English accent, although Paltrow captured the essence of Emma Woodhouse's character well. Additionally, the lack of development in the Mr. Elton-Ms. Smith relationship made it difficult for viewers to understand Emma's matchmaking attempts."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""Lili Marleen""?","I am terribly sorry, I know that Faßbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered ""master-pieces"", but when I see ""Lili Marleen"" today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for ""real art"", but for me this movie is simply bad & cheap. Compare this to Viscontis ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is a good movie...","The reviewer expressed disappointment in the acting, particularly calling out Hanna Schygulla's performance as lacking depth and authenticity. They found the transitions between different settings in the film to be poorly executed and felt that the overall production quality seemed rushed and amateurish. Additionally, they compared the film unfavorably to a work by Visconti, suggesting that ""Lili Marleen"" falls short in terms of cinematic quality."
What do you think about the chemistry between Tony Randall and Debbie Reynolds in the movie?,"Labored comedy has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigating eccentric farm family in Maryland who have never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the tomboy farmer's daughter who puts the squeeze on the not-so-disinterested tax-man. Debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period--and this one's no better or worse than the rest. Picture begins brightly but flags at the halfway point, becoming frantic and witless. Randall isn't a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry. Based on the novel ""The Darling Buds of May"" by H.E. Bates, with a poor sound-mix causing all the actors to sound as if they're stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****",
What are some aspects of the film that the reviewer found disappointing?,"I managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of MST3K, and oh boy, even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad. Imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkey.<br /><br />The highlights (what little there were) came from the special effects, which were ""OK"". The acting for the most part was also ""OK""; though nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other B-Movies I have seen in the past.<br /><br />The rest of this movie is dismally bad, The camera work often looks like they've just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along. The story (if it can be called that) is so full of holes it's almost funny, It never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place, or needs human flesh in order to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid. The climax to movie (if there is one) is absolutely laughable.<br /><br />If you can't find the MST3K version, avoid this at all costs.","The reviewer found the camera work to be amateurish, the story to be lacking coherence, the script poorly written, and the climax laughable. Additionally, the lack of explanation for the protagonist's survival and need for human flesh was frustrating."
What were some of the major issues that viewers had with this movie?,"This movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible. After I watched it, I actually felt the need to TAKE A SHOWER to get the filth off of me. There is running 'gag' with an elderly couple making out, it is not funny, but it is disgusting. The monster make up was cool, but that is all. The continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least I was. The editing is really poor.<br /><br />Almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends are into 'bad movies' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude, I couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it. You have been warned.","The movie was considered terrible by viewers, with complaints about scenes that were more disgusting than funny, poor editing, continuity errors, and an overall feeling of wanting to wash off the filth after watching it. Despite some cool monster makeup, the film's ineptitude and lack of humor made it unenjoyable for audiences."
What are some highlights of the movie that make it worth watching?,"Rebar is an astronaut who goes on the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course this being a horror movie things turn ugly and he returns to earth as the only survivor. Stricken with some bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his mind unless he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills what apparently is the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring town to stalk more victims.<br /><br />I liked the premise and the monster and gore effects are actually pretty good, but the space scenes are just pasted together out of stock NASA footage and the hospital looks curiously like a warehouse. A very weak script, little character development and overall poor acting keep this one from rising above being anything other than a mediocre slasher flick with the novelty of having a living candle as the killer, and more or less only has its gore effects to hold your interest.<br /><br />4 out of 10, strictly for the most die-hard monster movie fans.","The premise of the movie about an astronaut turning into a monster and the gore effects are the strong points, but the weak script, lack of character development, and poor acting make it a mediocre slasher flick."
"What are some positives and negatives of the movie ""A modern-day crime-obsessed teenager""?","Alicia Silverstone (pre-""Clueless"") plays a modern-day crime-obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which isn't especially well-made but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regards to its leading character. Silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here, despite the picture's kitschy undermining. The supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) isn't bad, though the violence in the last act goes overboard. Not a cheesy camp-fest, but nothing exceptionally memorable either. *1/2 from ****","The movie ""A modern-day crime-obsessed teenager"" features Alicia Silverstone in a solid performance, successfully portraying a complex young woman. Despite its serious-minded approach, the film falls short in terms of production quality and becomes overly violent towards the end. The supporting cast is decent, but overall the movie fails to leave a lasting impression, lacking in memorability."
How would you describe the lack of substance in the movie?,"The movie never becomes intolerable to watch. And to tell it straight, it has nothing to show either, except maybe part-sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing quite-sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there's nothing to follow -- you can see in either way. There is no suspense, little action, unimpressive dialogs, unsatisfactory sensuality, same boring locations and very bland acting. Kevin Dillon is totally worthless. Silverstone... well, I didn't concentrate too much on her acting, I confess. Yet as I said earlier, if one has nothing to do except watching a movie, this won't look so bad. 4/10","The movie lacks depth and fails to engage the audience with a dull storyline, unimpressive dialogue, and bland acting. The characters are uninteresting, leaving the viewer with little to follow or be invested in. Additionally, the lack of suspense and minimal action result in a tedious viewing experience. Kevin Dillon's performance is particularly lackluster, while even Alicia Silverstone's presence fails to elevate the overall mediocrity of the film."
What did you think about the pacing of the movie and development of the storyline?<br />,"I try to be very objective when I view a low budget movie. I also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions. I expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios. Therefore I apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases. But this movie was just a dud. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world. Also, to make this movie more mysterious, the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse.<br /><br />Once again another disappointing movie that I could only give three points to.","This movie really disappointed me. The pacing was off, and the storyline felt weak and unconvincing. The characters lacked depth, especially the main character, and I found it hard to stay engaged with the plot. The lighting choices in some scenes didn't help create the right atmosphere either, particularly in the warehouse scenes. I could only give this movie three points out of ten."
Did the movie highlight the historical and cultural aspects of Old Edo effectively?,"Underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas: it got lost in all the goo. The scenes of Old Edo -- with the courtesan, drifting on the Sumida, rehearsing and acting in the Nakamura-za -- were all exciting and engaging, taking you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed. The skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets, were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance. What a wasted opportunity! One of the best kabuki actors alive, and he gets lost in the dreck.","The movie failed to fully showcase the astounding art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro amidst the overwhelming computer graphics. Despite the exciting and engaging scenes of Old Edo and the captivating Kabuki stage performances, the film ultimately fell short with excessive high jinks and a disappointing plot, leading to a wasted opportunity to truly shine."
What made you feel like this movie lacked morals and failed to deliver on the comedy aspect?,"I thought this movie had absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fiancé left you on your wedding day for your cousin??? I would be heartbroken!! It's classified as a comedy but I didn't find it funny at all. I thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them. I normally love Julie Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee stars in another disgraceful show, which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society. It had a complete lack of taste and I despise movies like this. I understand that people will defend this movie and it's morals because it is 'Just a movie', but I still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn't be allowed on screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and parts of this movie were enjoyable, I'm just saying that in real life, people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful.","I loved this movie! It was so refreshing to see a romantic comedy take a unique twist with the love triangle involving the fiancé and cousin. The storyline kept me engaged throughout, and I found the humor to be quirky and clever. Julie Stiles was fantastic in her role, and Jason Lee brought a charming energy to the film. The comedic timing and chemistry between the characters were spot on, making for an enjoyable watch. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a light-hearted and entertaining romantic comedy."
Can you tell me more about the writing and humor in this movie?,"This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd, but we all know you can't. The writing is so obvious and facile, it's sad watching them try to sell it. The humor and pacing are so labored, it's hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this.<br /><br />That said, it's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen. We just have to know where this trainwreck goes. But that's only because we caught it on TV. If we had actually PAID for this, we'd be disgusted. <br /><br />So it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly/fascinatingly bad. And the incidental music (as opposed to the trying-too-hard indie soundtrack) is laughably reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo... but not as good.",
What is the general vibe of the movie and who does it seem to cater to?,"Just a regular Jason lee movie, There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an all right movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I didn't see it in the theater.","This Jason Lee movie is mediocre at best, with some mildly funny moments. It seems to target teenage girls and is the type of film you'd casually watch in the background. The pairing of Julia Stiles and Selma Blair is good, but the lack of a solid story and plot makes it fall flat."
What makes this movie fall short of being memorable?,"I just watched it. A couple of laughs, but nothing to write home about. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) DVD gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be punching a time clock, but then again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so ""well done"" I guess? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can't be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip, and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles father (hilariously), in 10 Things I Hate About You is funny here as well. He's great, but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her fold laundry, and I feel like I just did.","Despite some comedic moments and a solid cast, the overall plot lacked depth and the humor felt forced at times. The characters seemed one-dimensional, and the story failed to leave a lasting impression."
What are some aspects of the movie that disappointed the reviewer?,"I'm not a big fan of rom/coms at the best of times. A few have been quite good (check of Dream for an Insomniac), but this one is just more of the same but less.<br /><br />With a running time of 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins. The only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out Lee's character.<br /><br />All I can say is AVOID. I gaurentee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $$<br /><br />3 of out 10 (And only cos I'm a big Lee fan)","The reviewer found the movie repetitive for the rom/com genre and highlighted the lack of comedic moments throughout the 100-minute runtime. They specifically mentioned the scarcity of genuine laughter in the film and advised viewers to avoid it, suggesting there are better movies deserving of their money. The overall rating given was a low 3 out of 10, with the only positive aspect being the reviewer's admiration for Lee, the main actor."
What are some shortcomings of the movie's humor and overall content?,"I'm not a big fan of rom/coms at the best of times. A few have been quite good (check of Dream for an Insomniac), but this one is just more of the same but less.<br /><br />With a running time of 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins. The only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctively help out Lee's character.<br /><br />All I can say is AVOID. I guarantee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $$<br /><br />3 of out 10 (And only cos I'm a big Lee fan)","The humor in the movie falls flat with long gaps between laughs, and the story feels like a typical rom/com with nothing new to offer. There are far better movies deserving of your time and money."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find lacking in creating a connection with the audience?,"Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just fails to make a connect. <br /><br />Perhaps because Julia Stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law. <br /><br />Maybe it is because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been cast the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be).<br /><br />Either way this movie is yet another Hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation (that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin), which while having promise fails to deliver.<br /><br />There are some laughs to be sure and the cast (even if miscast) do their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic. So instead of getting a successful raunch fest (ie Animal House or American Pie) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something).","Jason Lee tries to inject humor into a silly script, but ultimately fails to engage viewers. Julia Stiles' characterization comes across as forced and awkward, while the casting choices for her and Selma Blair's roles seem mismatched. The movie falls short of its potential to explore real-life situations, opting instead for Hollywood's typical trivialization. Despite some comedic moments, the film struggles to rise above its raunchy premise, ending up as a mediocre blend of humor and foolishness."
Did the film meet your expectations based on the genre?,"What a terrible, TERRIBLE, film! One of the worst movies I have seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, the whole ""A guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes, but he happens to already be involved with someone, who not right for him...."". I expected something predictable and I didn't mind. The movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every single joke falls flat and the ""romance"" makes me want to vomit. The title character is one of the most ""please kill me"" characters that I have ever witnessed on my television, the ""eccentric woman"" isn't very eccentric, more like quirky and annoying. The ""other someone"" is the most reasonable, mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying. This films flat out sucks, there's no way around it, don't waste your time.","No, this film was a huge disappointment. The jokes were not funny, the romance was nauseating, and the characters were unbearable. It's safe to say that this movie was a waste of time."
What are some common criticisms of this movie?<br />,"I had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining, like other sorts of its genre. However, it was lame and I didn't find myself laughing very much. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I don't recommend paying to see it.<br /><br />The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been funny, maybe, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just don't go see this one. The directing is lackluster, but for what it is, directing isn't that important. I guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny. See something else, don't waste your time here.","This movie was a major letdown in terms of entertainment value. The humor fell flat for the most part, with only a few moments that garnered some laughs. The plot was simple yet lacked the cleverness needed to make it engaging. The directing was lackluster and overall, the film just wasn't very funny. It's best to skip this one and opt for something more enjoyable."
Did the movie have any redeeming qualities that could make it worth watching?,"Julia Stiles is a talented young actress, who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential. Obviously, the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career. I sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone. It was poorly written, the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care.","This film was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot was confusing, the acting was wooden, and the dialogue felt like it was written by someone who had never spoken to another human being. Even the impressive special effects couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
What was disappointing about Jason Lee's performance in the movie?,"I think Jason Lee has huge potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star. The plot is awful, the comedy is awful. I laughed twice, I think for relief, because in retrospect, they were fairly lame jokes. I found myself scared for the future of Fletch, and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed, not Lee.<br /><br />Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out, instead of this film. Save your time. 1 star.","The movie failed to do justice to Jason Lee's talent, with a weak plot and unfunny comedy that even managed to make the usually amusing actor fall flat."
Was the movie engaging and did it offer anything new or innovative?,"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen I don't really know why Just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who is about to get married, and starts to fancy someone else instead. Story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it at all.<br /><br />I don't really know what was wrong with this film. Most of the time when these kinds of actors/actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before, it's really entertaining. There are usually little clever thing in them that aren't really in any other. For some reason, this one just doesn't hold your attention. You can pick out some funny parts, or clever ideas in it, but for some reason they're just not funny, nor clever in any way I wish I new how to explain it, but I don't Just don't waste your time on this one","This movie was one of the most uninteresting films I've ever sat through. The storyline was incredibly generic, revolving around a man having doubts about his upcoming marriage and developing feelings for someone else. It felt like a recycled plot that offered nothing fresh or original. The movie failed to capture my attention, despite attempts at humor and clever moments that ultimately fell flat. I found it difficult to connect with the characters or find any redeeming qualities in the film. My advice would be to skip this one and not waste your time on it."
"What are some of the negative aspects of the film ""Frownland"" as indicated by the review?","I saw this film at SXSW with the director in attendance. Quite a few people walked out, and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is among the worst.<br /><br />At 106 minutes, it is at least 95 minutes too long. You get to watch the main character's failed and drawn out attempts to communicate, in extended real time. The same grimaces, hand over mouth motions, kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again - WE GET THE POINT.<br /><br />One site actually compares this work to early Mike Leigh. What drugs would you have to be on to make that statement? Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, maybe you'd have to be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film. Unbelievably, this won a jury award at the festival. You can bet it did not win an audience award.","The reviewer found the film too long at 106 minutes, with repetitive and drawn-out scenes that failed to engage the audience. The main character's communication attempts were described as tedious and overdone, making it difficult for viewers to stay invested. Additionally, the comparison of the film to early Mike Leigh was harshly criticized, as well as the selection of this film for a jury award at the festival."
How does Debbie Reynolds's performance contribute to the movie's atmosphere and plot?,"Debbie Reynolds toe-taps, tangos and, yes, tap-dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly fabricated '30s atmosphere. Two ladies, brought together when their sons commit a murder, try starting their lives over by running a tap-dance school for tots in Hollywood. Trouble is, one of them is plagued by neuroses. Can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with Robert Aldrich directing Bette Davis and Joan Crawford...? Nahh, Bette never would have allowed Joan so much screen-time to strut her stuff, and I can't imagine Bette Davis in the other role, tap-dancing her heart out. This is a purely bogus piece of macabre, written by a slumming Henry Farrell (whose idea of a good ""shock"" is to stage the mass-murder of a group of rabbits!). Not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package. *1/2 from ****","Debbie Reynolds gives a lively performance as she showcases her toe-tapping and tap-dancing skills in a thriller set in the '30s. However, the movie itself is critiqued as ordinary and fabricated, lacking genuine entertainment value. The plot revolves around two women who come together under unusual circumstances, but the storyline falls flat, with one of the characters dealing with neuroses. Overall, the film is dismissed as lacking in genuine excitement and creativity, receiving a low rating of *1/2 out of ****."
What were some strengths of the movie?,"Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the film wasn't the best I had seen. At the end of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it.<br /><br />Bette Davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and pity her all the while. Leslie Howard did very good as the lovelorn Philip Carey, and I so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame. It's such a sad thing when one finds him/herself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic.<br /><br />In the end, the acting was what came through and not the plot. The ending scene was particularly good, but I am not one to give it away. Although others may find this movie good, I was one who found it so-so. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person.","While Bette Davis delivered a stellar performance as Mildred and succeeded in making viewers despise and empathize with her character, the overall film left me feeling like it lacked something. The plot felt incomplete, relying heavily on the strong acting performances rather than a compelling storyline. Despite the poignant ending scene and Leslie Howard's solid portrayal of a lovelorn character, the movie failed to fully captivate me. I wouldn't highly recommend it to those seeking a riveting plot."
What makes the movie difficult to follow at certain points?,"First of all, I would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie, that the actor who played the ""Transvestite"" Is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he's a terrific actor, although it doesn't say much about his filmography, he's been in several plays and musicals. He is currently residing in Terrace B.C. that is where I am from, he comes over to our house almost every saturday *laughs* Okay, now about the movie, I wouldn't recomend this to anyone who HASN'T seen it, for it is not a movie worth watching, the main reason I found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place, it keeps bouncing back between time, so kinda hard to follow at some points, and second, its really boring *laughs* Although the acting is great, the movie just doesn't compare.","The movie bounces back between time, making it hard to keep up with the storyline and ending up boring despite the great acting."
Would you say this movie is appropriate for young children?,"Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, once was enough!","The movie was so unsettling to me that I couldn't even finish watching it. The scenes with gruesome acts were truly horrifying, especially for a first grader. Even though it might be rated PG, I strongly advise against showing it to small children. The content is simply not suitable for them, and I regret watching it at such a young age."
What were you expecting from the movie based on the hype and anticipation?,"I'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we'd both heard that this was a terrifying film, really scary. How disappointed was I?? VERY!!!! Apart from that one scene (we all know which bit) NOTHING happened!!! I was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes, like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something.<br /><br />Nearly all the reviews here say what a scary, gripping, atmospheric movie this is. I just didn't see it I'm afraid. Maybe there's a difference in what people find scary in the US to here in Britain.<br /><br />A big let down after all the hyped reviews :(","The anticipated scary atmosphere and gripping scenes were majorly lacking, leading to a massive disappointment."
"What are your thoughts on the show ""Gloria"" based on the negative review?","Today, Bea Arthur died so I was cruising around the IMDb Web site and somehow wound up on a show called ""Gloria."" ""All In The Family"" was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and I bet I watched every episode more than once. However, I swear that I did NOT know a show named ""Gloria"" existed. Maybe, that's a good thing. Maybe, it means I had a life as a young adult rather than watching television.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is pathetic that the ""All In The Family"" franchise had deteriorated so much that it begat a show I never heard of -- and one that is rated very poorly by the previous reviewers.<br /><br />I rated the show a 1 for two reasons -- the system did not allow me to register a no vote and writers and TV execs should be condemned for starting a show that had no business being on the air and besmirches the memory of one of the greatest shows in TV history.<br /><br />Shalom, ZWrite","The negative reviewer expressed disappointment in the creation of the show ""Gloria"" as a spin-off of the beloved series ""All In The Family."" The reviewer believed the show had no merit and should not have been on air, ultimately tarnishing the legacy of its predecessor."
"What are some of the shortcomings of the movie ""Conquest""?","I like Fulci films, i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people.<br /><br />Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed. Structurally, it's like most Fulci films you've seen. Some stuff happens, some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another. Really it's like Conan with no sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore.<br /><br />This one was a hard one to get through and i could've lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that Hair Metal music video look.","The movie ""Conquest"" falls short in its attempt to delve into the epic fantasy genre, with a lack of coherent structure, minimal sets and budget, subpar actors, and unimpressive visuals. Additionally, the excessive use of vaseline on the camera gives it a tacky Hair Metal music video appearance, making it a challenging watch."
What are some major flaws in this movie?,"Warning: This review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said, ""almost"". This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them ""heroes"") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons. There's also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. If you're in a MST3K mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead.","The movie was described as impressively bad, with a loose storyline that consists of random scenes. The protagonists engage in unethical acts like shooting innocent people and robbing them for food. There is also an uncomfortable amount of homoeroticism in the film. The villainess, though not naked as other reviews suggest, seems to die but inexplicably comes back to extend the torture for the audience. The reviewer also suspects animal abuse may have occurred on set, making it difficult to enjoy the film overall."
Can you think of a movie that made you question the sanity of those who financed it?,"This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at just how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are absolutely first grade level, as in any first grader could have done them. Toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign, and a laughable story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to ""Conquest"". Every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie.","""Conquest"" is an absolute disaster of a film. From the laughable special effects to the completely absurd storyline, this movie sets a new low for cinematic quality. It's so bad that even Ed Wood's infamous movies look like masterpieces in comparison. Watch ""Conquest"" if you want to understand what a truly terrible movie looks like."
Can you share a brief summary of the plot of the movie?,"I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there's really not much to talk of. Just a mish-mash of other FAR better sword & sorcery epics. Lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality. Even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy.Mildly amusing in it's ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it's worst. Lucio Fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Posters & Stills galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US & International Theatrical trailers <br /><br />Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless throughout (some may consider that appealing, I did not); various extras are topless as well","This film lacks cohesiveness and seems to be a mish-mash of better sword & sorcery epics. The main villainess's insistence on wearing a loincloth only adds to the boredom of the movie. Overall, the film's ineptitude ranges from mildly amusing to severely disappointing, showing that Lucio Fulci was really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one."
"What made ""Sir"" John Gielgud star in this mess of a movie according to the reviewer?","""Sir"" John Gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one.;<br /><br />This is one of those films, I suppose, that is considered ""art,"" but don't be fooled.....it's garbage. Stick to the ""art"" you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this.<br /><br />In this masterpiece, Giegud recites Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" while the camera pans away to nude people. one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool. Wow, this is heady stuff and real ""art,"" ain't it?? That's just one example. Most of the story makes no sense, is impossible to follow and, hence, is one that Liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't ""understand"" so they give it high marks to save their phony egos. You want Shakespeare? Read his books.","The reviewer harshly criticizes the film, calling it a garbage and questioning its artistic value. They believe the movie is filled with unintelligible scenes, including reciting Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" while showing nude people, including a child urinating in a swimming pool. The reviewer finds the story nonsensical and impossible to follow, accusing liberal critics of giving it high marks just to protect their egos."
Can you tell me why you didn't enjoy this movie?,"I saw this movie when it was released, and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these years. <br /><br />Here's why: <br /><br />Greenaway's goal seems to be to take every literary image in the Tempest and make it literal. If a character were to say, ""my heart takes flight,"" we'd be shown an actual human heart, with pigeon wings attached, flapping across the screen. <br /><br />This process makes for some lush tableaux, but ultimately it's a facile exercise. And it becomes deadly boring.<br /><br />I don't begrudge the pleasure other viewers found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enraptured.","I found this movie to be quite disappointing. Greenaway's attempt to visually represent every literary image in the Tempest came off as excessive and superficial. The lavish visuals did little to make up for the lack of substance, leading to a tedious viewing experience. I can understand why some may have enjoyed it, but it failed to captivate me."
What were some of the major flaws of the movie that led to disappointment in the viewer?,"This seems like one of those movies that we think we should like, but I didn't. It seemed to be trying way too hard to be 'artsy'. All flash, with no content. It has some beautiful scenes, and any one of them are nice to watch, but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it. I rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton, and the fact that I'm a big Shakespeare fan, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit pretentious and, at times, boring.","The film seemed to be trying too hard to be 'artsy', lacking substance and coming across as pretentious. It had some visually beautiful scenes, but when put together, it became tedious to watch."
Can you recommend this movie to someone else?,"I bought a DVD of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie was shot entirely on video, so it has the look of a PBS special about it. The special effects are phoney looking, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat. There is a particularly effective scare involving a Virgin Mary statue.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the ""plot"" scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you I have no clue what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $5.","The special effects may be unconvincing and the acting subpar, but the film does have its fair share of scary moments that will make you jump in your seat. The plot scenes are long and tedious, and the ending leaves viewers confused. It's worth renting for a casual watch, but not worth buying for more than $5."
What makes this movie disappointing?,I expect the same excitement as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE but I was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie ( its kinda of a mini porno) . It made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. There is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder. If you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there's spots in the movie for and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all. I have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 . I want be watching it again at all. The actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie.,"The movie lacks a coherent storyline, jumps too quickly between scenes, and includes graphic scenes that some viewers may find disturbing or even classify it as a mini porno. The actors seem uninterested, raising questions about their motivation for participating in the film."
What makes this horror movie so unappealing?,"NO SPOILERS.<br /><br />I love horror movies, but this has got to be the poorest attempt to make one ever. Calling it ""a movie"" is also a stretch. This ""random-clips-of-obviously-fake-and-tacky-violence-and-an-ugly- woman-trying-to-act-sexy-edited-poorly-together"" is not worth watching.<br /><br />Watching this is about as interesting watching as some random family's holiday pictures, and it has about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new vid-cam, and tell him to make a movie.<br /><br />Terrible.","The horror movie in question falls flat, failing with poorly executed fake violence and unconvincing attempts at creating suspense. The editing is choppy, and the overall result is reminiscent of amateur filmmaking rather than a professional production."
Can you please share your thoughts on the movie's entertainment value and humor level?,"I watch bad movies.<br /><br />This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent throughout.<br /><br />I am LAZY.<br /><br />Usually, I see a bad movie and curse. This was so bad, I actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess I fell victim to.<br /><br />I am smashing my copy of this movie.<br /><br />It's too lame even to use clear a room. So boring. Watch 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment. This sludge looks awful, is awful, and whoever made it should feel awful.","This movie lacks any humor and entertainment value. It was so dull that I felt compelled to write a review to warn others to steer clear of this complete mess. The lack of talent is evident throughout, making it a painful viewing experience."
What are some reasons to avoid watching this movie?,"Picture the fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat film, throw in a pinch of story and a whole lot of awful acting, and you are still not even close to how bad this movie is.<br /><br />Shot badly, bad effects, worse acting. Contrived attempt at shocking horror. Everyone I've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it. The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just foul, even before she gets to the guy.<br /><br />I'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate, which is why I picked this one up. But for your own sake, save yourself the time and avoid this abhorrence. It's that bad. I literally threw it in the garbage.","The movie is poorly shot, with bad effects and worse acting. It tries too hard to be shocking with disturbing sex scenes that make viewers feel depressed. The last sex scene is particularly repulsive. Overall, it's a movie to be avoided at all costs."
What aspects of the 2007 version were particularly disappointing?,"Am I wrong,or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original? I have to ask because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst films I have ever seen.....bad acting,bad editing etc....the only ""exploitation "" aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap. It is nothing more than a light-weight porn flick...no real gore, no scary images, just a cheaply done bit of garbage. If anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors,some slimy gore and a decent storyline...get Baby Blood...also done on a cheap budget but well made...and an actual story too!I Spit was a waste of money but I'll keep it just for a laugh....it is pathetic! New comment....Sept 3.....I'll keep this film forever just because it it SOOOOO bad it's almost good....in a really bad way....the worst acting ever...a real crap-movie classic!","The 2007 version was criticized for being a rip-off of the original, with bad acting, editing, and overall production quality. It was described as nothing more than a cheaply done piece of garbage, lacking real gore and scary images. The film was labeled a waste of money and a pathetic excuse for a movie, with the worst acting ever."
What genre does this movie fall under and what did you find particularly engaging about it?,"This movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director has really ""kept it real"" and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life. I had to watch other films by this director for a class, the others were not as boring. This film was also watched for an assignment...it better be worth the boringness with a good grade!! Overall, unless it's required, don't watch the film. But don't discount other films by this director, because they're not as bad...and don't discount other films about Africa, they're usually good, especially when done by a western director.","The movie is extremely boring, following a female gas station owner with nothing exciting happening. It feels like a documentary, simply showing her day-to-day life. I had to watch it for a class assignment and found it to be a tedious experience. I wouldn't recommend watching it unless mandatory."
What type of emotions did the movie evoke in the viewer?,"Few films have left me with such a feeling of unease, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (How it ended there I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 mn of hateful, derivative garbage, the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie ""Don't answer the phone"" - but worse. The nastiness of it all, rape and all, is shown without any distance (unlike strong stuff like ""Last house on the left"") and utter contempt for the (perfect ?) victims and everybody involved, leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur. At the end I felt like taking a shower. No credits to the director",The movie evoked a strong feeling of unease and hatred due to its graphic and contemptuous portrayal of violent acts without any sense of empathy towards the victims.
What are the main drawbacks of this movie?,"While not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works, this slow-moving, repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half, but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement.<br /><br />To be sure, the actors are above average - considering this is an Argento movie - and some moments show the director's visual skills, but whole sequences should've been cut and, basically, it's just the same exploitative trash as ever, wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity.<br /><br />3 out of 10 genetic disorders","The movie is criticized for being slow-moving, repetitive, and growing increasingly lethargic and silly towards its disappointing ending. Despite some nice touches and above-average actors, it is deemed as exploitative trash that wallows in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity."
"What was disappointing about the movie ""Search and Destroy"" despite having a star-studded cast?","Rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, and John Turturro, all jumped on board, only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a Hollywood in joke. Attaching Martin Scorsese's name to this was probably the draw, but the end result is way less than the sum of it's parts. Resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong, each scene seems more contrived than the next. ""Search and Destroy"" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self indulgent nonsense, and the entire film is decidedly dull.......... MERK","The film ""Search and Destroy"" fails to live up to its potential, wasting its incredible ensemble of talented actors on a convoluted and self-indulgent script. The movie comes across as nothing more than a failed attempt at being stylish and artistic, ultimately resulting in a dull and unengaging viewing experience."
What flaws can be seen in the movie?,"From the start, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of clichés your typical NRA member will not even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, only because of the acting of William Benton. I can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. It's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' (once a thief...). People aren't born bad. Neither are they born good. They are born with a clean slate. It's society, parents and education what makes them who they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the line, it certainly isn't going to be the American penal system that gets them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap.<br /><br />","The movie is full of clichés and biased towards a certain point of view, making it unappealing even for viewers who typically enjoy this genre. The storyline is predictable right from the start, and the only redeeming factor is the acting of William Benton. Overall, the movie only deserves a 2 out of 10 rating."
What aspect of the film was particularly unappealing to the reviewer?,"This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was, as I did, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, then you won't find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on John Kerry, but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal.","The reviewer found the film to be extremely boring due to repetitive footage and arguments from the Vietnam War era, as well as the uninteresting narration by director Carlton Sherwood."
What themes does the movie explore?,"That is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth's yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing British school. Oh yes it's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you're asked to. Yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. Great.<br /><br />Basically that's how you could sum up the nice intentions in If... Nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamatory movie. Do you see how boring I mean?<br /><br />At least that oldie helped Kubrick cast McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self-indulgent sentimentalism.","While the movie attempts to depict the longing for freedom among young people, it comes across as outdated and fails to present any significant cinematic challenges. The film ends up being declamatory and boring, lacking the impactful social satire found in movies like A Clockwork Orange."
Was the movie trying too hard to be funny?,"Possibly not, but it is awful. Even the fantastic cast cant save it. OK, I admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals house. Bill Murray turned from being a quick witted, humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny, its like he was trying too hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released.","The movie started off quite funny but plummeted downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals house. Bill Murray's character went from being quick-witted to an arsehole, shouting unfunny things on the street. The film portrays the US Army in an inadequate and incompetent light, leaving the viewers feeling disgusted by its propaganda."
Can you elaborate on what makes you feel that 'Hijack Stories' is not up to par with other South African films? What specific aspects of the movie do you think fall short compared to others in the industry?,"What an insult to the SA film industry! I have seen better SA films. The comments I read about Hijack Stories,by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary. A movie's rating should not depend on.., ""OH, A MOVIE FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. LETS BOOST THEIR INDUSTRY BY SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT THEIR WORK, EVEN THOUGH IT IS BAD."" We have the expertise to make good movies. Don't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think Hijack Stories is. We can tell great stories such as Cry the beloved Country and Shaka Zulu. Cry the beloved Country I'll give 9 out of 10. Great directing by Darryl, great acting by two great elderly actors, irrespective from where they are. Hijack Stories.., I'll give 1 out of 10. It could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores. I would've done the same if it was my movie.",
What could have been done to improve the plot and character development in this movie?,"From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was ""older"". End of that story.","The plot of this movie was incredibly weak, with minimal explanation or context for the characters that appeared. The pacing was slow, leaving me counting down the minutes until it was over. While there were a couple of intriguing scenes, overall the lack of character depth and unresolved themes left much to be desired."
What issues did the reviewer have with the film's portrayal of a father-son relationship and the themes of alienation and distance?<br />,"The film begins with promise, but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We are left hanging, but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour. Certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over. It's a shame, because the concept is not without merit.<br /><br />We are left wondering why a loving couple - a father and son no less - should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining. This loss of presence in the real world is, rather too obviously and unnecessarily, contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces. Why not the circus, so we can at least appreciate some colour? We are left with a gnawing sense of loss, but sadly no enlightenment, which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all.","The film failed to effectively explore the complexities of the father-son relationship and the themes of alienation and distance, leaving viewers feeling disconnected and without a satisfying resolution. The sepia-toned cinematography and languid pacing resulted in a lackluster viewing experience, with a disappointing absence of emotional depth and character development."
What elements make this movie visually appealing despite its confusing plot?,"This film is beautiful to look at, but is like watching really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) doesn't make any sense. But it is very ""artistic"". Lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes. Lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame. Mumbling and people wandering wistfully. Lingering close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY at the screen.<br /><br />It is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship, but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f*$& each other and get it over with. If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shots, your wish has been granted.",This film lacks a coherent storyline and instead indulges in pretentious artistic scenes that come off as confusing and overly indulgent. The focus on half-dressed actors engaging in odd interactions and the unclear father-son relationship make it difficult to connect with the characters or storyline. The attempts at being artistic only serve to make the movie feel like a misguided experiment rather than a meaningful cinematic experience.
Can you provide an in-depth review of the film?,"I consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama, I can be very stuck up about films, too.<br /><br />Not all art films, however, are better than King Kong. I quite possibly would give Kong two stars, double this film's haul.<br /><br />My guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play. For the less discerning art-buff, a film that looks like a play is 'great art'.<br /><br />This film, however, was useless.<br /><br />There was hardly any story so it relied on high drama. The only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not. So, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great acting? Hardly.<br /><br />To be excessively fair: Some of the scenery was interesting, though: Communist flats, city vistas (Petersburg?) and the Soviet trams still in service.","The movie was deemed as lackluster by a self-proclaimed film snob who typically appreciates high drama. The film was criticized for lacking a captivating story and meaningful dialogue, relying heavily on dramatic moments such as a cat potentially falling off a roof. Despite some interesting scenery, like Communist flats and city vistas, the overall consensus was that the film was useless and did not offer strong acting performances."
What are some of the major issues with the directing in The Shield according to the reviewer?,"To sat how awful The Shield is, you'd have to write pages and pages, so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing.<br /><br />""When Directors Go Awry"" should have been the title of this production. Indeed, directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story forward.<br /><br />How is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a ""style""? How is it propelling the story forward? Of course there's also the ""editing by random numbers"" nonsense. Apparently it's become hip to just cut randomly.<br /><br />I guess it's too much work to do good editing.<br /><br />Well, that made it too much work for most people to watch The Shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched shows of all time.",
What do you think about the overall production quality of The Shield?,"I have no idea what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is practically unwatchable.<br /><br />Supposedly the performances on The Shield are great...<br /><br />In reality, the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances. For instance, the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact.<br /><br />I don't know what intellectual rationale there is for that, but it robs the show of all emotional impact.<br /><br />I'll give The Shield one point for ambition in its subject matter, but that's pretty much all I can give it.<br /><br />It's a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed.","The Shield is practically unwatchable, with poor editing that diminishes the impact of the performances and robs the show of emotional depth. Despite having ambitious subject matter, the talented performers are wasted due to strange and poorly executed filming."
Can you elaborate on the strengths and weaknesses of the film's script and direction?,"Oh dear. good cast, but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task. Even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right. Im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times. The main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue, that made some people in the film annoying. It may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task. And the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film. Overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me, but I'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good. Sorry.","The film boasts a talented cast, but unfortunately, the attempt to write and direct with humor fell short. The comedic timing seemed off, with only a few moments eliciting genuine laughter. The fast-paced dialogue, while aiming to be engaging, resulted in certain characters being more irritating than entertaining. The hand-held camera work did inject some energy into select scenes, but overall, the script lacked the charm needed to translate well onto the screen."
Can you tell me about a movie that you recently watched and thoroughly enjoyed?,"It pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so I'm simply encouraging these people. First off, just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing. In fact in this case, the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits. Have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre? Ever heard people laugh and thought ""what the dickens are you on""? Well even these twats weren't laughing. Things got so bad by mid way my cat took his first ever bath. This is not film, this is children....no monkeys making images that leave you feeling like moving to France. Got to go, there's a clown at my door.............","This movie was an absolute delight to watch. From start to finish, it had me completely captivated. The storyline was incredibly engaging, and the characters were so well-developed that I found myself fully invested in their journey. The acting was superb, with each actor delivering a standout performance that truly brought their character to life. The cinematography was stunning, with beautifully shot scenes that added to the overall visual appeal of the film. The sound design was also top-notch, further immersing me into the world of the movie. Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a truly memorable cinematic experience."
What is the film about and how is it presented?,"I had never heard of this one before it turned up on Cable TV. It's very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low-budget venture! While not uninteresting in itself (the-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile angle later utilized, with far greater aplomb, for both DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and mercifully short, the film's single-minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter - particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents!","The film sounds like a low-budget, awkwardly executed sci-fi movie from the late 50s. It showcases a typical storyline with a documentary style presentation, heavy reliance on narration, and an overuse of stock footage. The single-minded focus on the subject matter leads to unintentional laughter, especially in scenes involving childbirth and juvenile delinquents."
What are some of the criticisms of the film?,"This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish, with only good/bad characters. The world is just not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I HATE most about this film is Bola's friend's father. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average looking dad (wow, this is like... philosophy, or something). Thank you, Achero. I'll propose you for the Nobel prize of literature.","The film is considered overrated due to its lack of subtlety, complexity, and reliance on good/bad characters. It is criticized for its oversimplification of the world and its attempt at forced political correctness, which comes across as childish. The character of Bola's friend's father is particularly criticized for the director's heavy-handed attempt at delivering a moral lesson."
What stands out in this film according to the review?,"I was watching this with one of my friends, who is a vampire freak, and I was extremely disgusted at the fact that this film exists. This film should be shown to prisoners of war, yes, it's that bad. Even John McCain wouldn't be able to sit through this. So why the 3/10 rating? Because it had a vampire midget. Come on, what's more entertaining than a vampire midget? There's one scene in this film where John Savage gets laid by saying ""I want to feel human again,"" and the chick, being the brainless stripper slut she is, lets him ""feel human"". I wish I could ""feel human"" with Jessica Alba or Megan Fox. This is a movie for stoners. There is bright flashy objects and random movements. All in all, don't waste your money on this garbage. I got it for free when I was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a garbage barrel full of video tapes and a sign that said ""free"". So, in a way, I didn't get ripped off, but still...","The review suggests that the film stands out because of the inclusion of a vampire midget, which the reviewer found entertaining despite overall deeming the movie as disgusting and a waste of time."
What makes this movie so hard to watch and disappointing for the reviewer?,"This movie was horrible. I watched it three times, and not even the whole thing. It's just impossible to watch, the story line sucks, it's depressing, and utterly disgusting. I don't write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning, and some funny parts in the movie. The little kid in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie at movie stores around America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, was I wrong!!!! The acting is all horrible, and the nudity itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is, Starr Andreef, the other main character, hasn't been in such bad movies in the past, in fact, she was in some pretty good ones. Same with John Savage. This movie SUCKS!","The negative reviewer found the movie horrible, mentioning the poor story line, depressing content, and disgusting scenes. They also criticized the acting, specifically calling the nudity lame and nasty. However, they acknowledged the performances of John Savage being a rare positive in an otherwise terrible movie."
"Can you describe the weaknesses of the movie ""Vampire Club""?","This is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of Roger Corman is associated with it. I could've understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuses for giving birth to this! I'm a ""B"" movie pervert and from certain people point of view all the flicks I love are put aside by ""regular viewers"" but take my word on this one, Vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst.It's hard to Imagine, vampires with no fangs, the music score is totally out of place,the sound effects are just not effective and finally Mr.Savage doesn't seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad 'cause he had a ""not to bad"" career over all. Let me know i'f I'm to hard on this one cause when I don't like a movie I tend to forget about it's good side.","The movie ""Vampire Club"" has been heavily criticized for its poor execution and lack of coherence. The absence of fangs on the vampires, misplaced music score, ineffective sound effects, and the disinterest of the lead actor all contribute to its downfall. Despite some redeeming qualities, these flaws overshadow any potential enjoyment the film could have offered."
What can viewers expect from the film Dakota (1988)?,"Dakota (1988) was another early Lou Diamond Phillips starring vehicle. This film is similar to the later released film Harley. There are a few differences but they're both the same. I don't know which one came first. I guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life. But they both are troubled ""kids"" who are trying to turn there lives around. Instead of bikes this one involves horses. They're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. If you're a serious L.D.P. fan then I recommend that you watch them both. You get some extreme mugging and posturing from L.D.P. if you're game then go for it.<br /><br />Not recommended, except for L.D.P. fans!!!","Dakota (1988) may appeal to fans of Lou Diamond Phillips, but overall, it is considered cheesy and not recommended for general audiences. The film is criticized for being too similar to another movie starring Phillips and lacks depth in its storytelling."
Can you elaborate on some of the issues you had with the film's plot and cast?,"This film is too skeletal. It's a fairly low-budget film (I hope!) which excuses it somewhat, but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much. Phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family who's searching for himself (though his family is...er...well, a little too white...), but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws. Every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are *way* too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency. They needed filler...) I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard-core Phillips fan, or who has absolutely *nothing* to do. 4/10.",
What can you tell me about the technical quality of this movie?,"There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk, no IFPI code in the inner rim.<br /><br />Probably a straight transfer from VHS. <br /><br />There is no much point is commenting an adult film. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas.<br /><br />I've seen it In Pensylvannia way back in 1975.<br /><br />As such it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD has no special features and no subtitles, and was probably made using a VHS tape as source","The technical quality of the DVD publication in the UK in 2002, with code HRGD002 on the cover, VFC 19796 on the disk, and no ASIN or IFPI code, appears to be subpar. It is likely a direct transfer from VHS, lacking special features and subtitles."
What is your main complaint about the lead actress in the movie?,"a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like ""Debbie does Dallas"". Nowhere close. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever. Even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time. But I read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some ""artistic"" value. I was unable to find it though. See it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies. I know I am not. But the director of the movie appears to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs. Of course, they rejected.",
What aspects of the TV series did the reviewer find disappointing compared to the Sookie Stackhouse books?,"As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be a totally crass representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book. I found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through Sookie is always a lady, and yet in the TV series she doesn't seem like that at all. Not only that but the prejudices displayed in the TV series are not nearly as wide spread in the books. I didn't expect an exact replica of the books but I at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series.","The reviewer, as a fan of the books, was dissatisfied with the portrayal of characters in the TV series. They felt that Vampire Bill was not as attractive as described in the books and that the characters seemed crass and vulgar, in contrast to the colorful and dignified portrayal in the novels. The reviewer also expressed disappointment with the differences in how prejudices were depicted between the books and the TV adaptation. The lack of the book's essence and refined nature in the series left the reviewer feeling unsatisfied."
What did you like and dislike about the latest addition to the Cracker series?,"As a huge fan or the Cracker series, I have been waiting 7 years for the next addition. This Episode I'm afraid just does not live up to the legend.<br /><br />Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation were a soldier, tormented by flash backs from his tour of duty in Northern Irland, goes on a killing spree.<br /><br />What I did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how fitz is led to the murderer. It is all fat to far-fetched.<br /><br />There are however some good scenes in flash backs from Northern Irland which are filmed great.","As a huge fan of the Cracker series, I have been eagerly anticipating the next episode for 7 long years. Unfortunately, this latest addition fails to meet the high standards set by its predecessors. Fitz's return to Manchester for his daughter's wedding and subsequent involvement in a murder investigation involving a soldier haunted by war flashbacks feels too contrived and unrealistic. The convenience of how everything unfolds and how Fitz swiftly identifies the murderer is disappointingly far-fetched. Despite these shortcomings, the flashbacks to Northern Ireland are visually impressive and offer some redeeming moments."
"What are some of the main flaws in the movie ""Cracker Returns"" according to the review?","A major disappointment. This was one of the best UK crime drama / detective shows from the 90's which developed the fascinating title character played by Scotland's Robbie Coltrane. However this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus. Coltrane isn't really given much to do, much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer, and in what he has to act in, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. The ex-soldier's story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on Coltrane's family life seems lightweight. Perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth. As is, skip this and watch the old Cracker from the 90's which is far far superior.","The film ""Cracker Returns"" is described as a major letdown compared to the original UK crime drama series from the 90's. The review criticizes the lack of character development for the lead role played by Robbie Coltrane, pointing out his seemingly disinterested performance. The focus on the uninteresting killer, unengaging plotline, and superficial exploration of Coltrane's family life are highlighted as weaknesses. The reviewers suggest skipping this movie and watching the original series instead for a superior experience."
Can the movie be considered a fulfilling sequel to the original series or does it fall short?,"The social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting. <br /><br />I even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in England. Can he not insinuate himself on the Australian police? It seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation.<br /><br />The latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on silliness, and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one. Sad.","The social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable.

What were some major flaws in the film that made it disappointing for the reviewer?,"Having heard so much about the 1990s Cracker series without seeing any of them, I looked forward to this eagerly. Surely the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /><br />The polemics, backed by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were overpowering. The production tried to be super-modern, but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated. Robbie Coltrane sleep-walked through the two hours, coming up with unexplained and unlikely ""insights"", and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots. As a result, the tension never built up and the next-to-final scene (no details for fear of spoilers) was as laughably bad a piece of TV drama as I have seen for a long time.<br /><br />No, I don't want to see any more of these, but I will go back to the DVDs of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation.","The reviewer was let down by the excessive polemics, repetitive flashbacks, and violent scenes that overpowered the narrative. They found the modern production elements like flashing boxes and childish font irritating. The performance of Robbie Coltrane was lackluster, his character delivering unexplained and unlikely insights. The police characters were portrayed as one-dimensional and bumbling, failing to contribute to building any tension. The reviewer considered a crucial scene towards the end as laughably bad and labeled it as one of the worst TV drama moments they had seen in a long time."
What aspects of the movie fell short for you?,"This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but also not that bad either. In my opinion PG13 movies aren't scary enough so that's why I already knew I was going to be bored throughout the entire film. Sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we all haven't already seen. I guess I didn't like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns happening; it got old and repetitive. I also didn't understand if all the things Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about. What I did like was the special effects. Other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it. Maybe its just me but I thought this was below average.","The movie ""1408"" left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. I found the PG13 rating to strip away the potential for genuine scare factor, resulting in a boring viewing experience. The scary elements in the hotel room felt unoriginal and failed to captivate my interest. The abundance of twists and turns in the storyline became tiresome and repetitive, leaving me confused and disconnected from the plot. The lack of explanation for the events that unfolded in the room left me feeling frustrated and questioning the coherence of the film. The movie dragged on without a clear resolution, leaving me wanting more closure. Overall, despite the decent special effects, I found ""1408"" to be below average and lacked the enjoyment I was hoping for."
What are some weaknesses of the movie Jungle Fever?,"Jungle Fever is too highly stylized, stereotyped, and comes across as essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Even though there's plenty of talent in this movie, it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. Also, instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is, Spike Lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner. I made it through most of the film but I couldn't quite finish it, and that, for me, rarely happens.","The movie Jungle Fever received negative feedback for being highly stylized, stereotyped, and portraying dishonesty. Wesley Snipes was considered wrong for the lead role and lacked chemistry with Annabella Sciorra. The talented cast was largely wasted with reduced roles, and the portrayal of racism was criticized for being whiny and irritating. The reviewer struggled to finish the film due to these issues."
Can you elaborate on why you walked out of this movie?,"I have walked out of very few movies before they end, but I couldn't finish this piece of garbage. This was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since ""Birth of a Nation"". The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film. Lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do.... like watching paint dry. I wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically. There is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like Lee.","This movie was filled with racist undertones, the characters lacked depth, and the storyline felt shallow. The director's approach to interracial relationships was disappointing, and watching this film felt like a waste of time."
What effect does the pervasive darkness throughout the movie Malice have on the overall viewing experience?,"When I refer to Malice as a film noir I am not likening it to such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor am I comparing director Becker to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I am merely registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from start to finish, to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on. I can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight, for what reason I am at loss to understand. As it is, however, it wouldn't have made much difference if director Becker had filmed it in total darkness.","The darkness in Malice is so overwhelming that it becomes difficult to follow the storyline. The lack of visibility, even during daytime scenes, hinders the viewer's ability to fully engage with the movie and understand what is happening. This excessive darkness detracts from the viewing experience and makes it hard to appreciate the film as a whole."
What aspects of the movie failed to impress you?,"I saw this movie a few years back on the BBC i sat thru it. How? i don't know,this is way up there in the ""so bad it'Good "" charts Kidman ,Baldwin,and Pullman must cringe when they see it now.I think Woody Allen would have worked wonders with the outlandish plot, and Baldwin's part could have been played with gusto by Leslie Nelson.it was on again tonight i tried to watch it again but life's too short. the few minutes i watched was for the lovely Nicole she was so hot around 93, has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman played his stock in trade ""nice but dim"" character the F-word coming out of his mouth when the lady from ""frasier"" miscast ed as a detective accuses him of murder sounds so wrong. stay well away.","The movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot was so absurd that even talented actors like Kidman, Baldwin, and Pullman couldn't salvage it. The casting choices felt completely off, with Pullman playing his cliched ""nice but dim"" character, and even the usually reliable Baldwin falling short. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, especially with the out-of-place use of foul language. Overall, this film is a trainwreck that is best avoided."
Can you provide a negative review of this movie based on the critics' feedback?,"Irene Dunne finished her illustrious career with this so-so movie. She should have gone out with a bang, being the classy actress she was, not in this unmemorable, almost unknown film. <br /><br />This lightweight comedy is okay, but nothing special. The first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit. Even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here. Rumor has it she was not happy with this film. One can see why.<br /><br />The story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom. Speaking of that, I thought David Nelson from the Ozzie & Harriet TV show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded just like Nelson.<br /><br />Overall, so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress.","The movie's lightweight comedy was nothing special, and despite starting off decently, it took a turn for the worse in the second half, becoming pretty stupid. Criticisms were directed towards Irene Dunne's performance as well, with her high-pitched voice being labeled as annoying. The film was compared to a 1950s sitcom and was overall considered so-so, providing a sub-par ending for a well-regarded actress like Irene Dunne."
What movie should be avoided at all costs?,"For the love of god please don't see this movie! Its a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are the romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with very little, this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame. The characters aren't developed, and most of the film is padded out with shots of Rome, which is much more interesting than the actual film. To top all of that, the acting is a disgrace. I know everyone tries to find their niche, but this is truly a disaster. I can't believe that someone actually paid however many millions of pounds to put this film on screen. Don't waste money or time on this film, go see your grandma or something worthwhile instead.","The movie features a predictable plot, lackluster romantic scenes, underdeveloped characters, and unimpressive acting. It heavily relies on shots of Rome to compensate for its weak storyline, and the villain is portrayed as evil in a cliché manner. It's a total waste of time and money, definitely not worth watching."
"What are some unbelievable elements in the movie ""Mary-Kate & Ashley's When in Rome""?","This movie really has no beginning or end. And it's really VERY unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they're put up in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum), and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model-looking as they are. One thing that I found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins DOESN'T end up with the guy. I guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit. Nice try.","The movie really stretches believability with unrealistic scenarios like interns staying in a 5-star hotel and all intern characters being abnormally good-looking models. Additionally, the unexpected twist of one of the twins not ending up with the guy feels forced and deviates from their typical storyline."
What do you think about the repetitive nature of the movies starring the two lead actresses?,"No ,I'm not kidding. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their movies are exactly the same in every one, and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem which they easily resolve, hoping to be popular, and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me its name. These ""movies"" are poor excuses to be on TV and go to other countries. There is a reason that the movies never go to theaters. I'm sure that when they were really young and made some O.K. movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now that they're, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio's money. Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!","It's really disappointing to see that the movies always follow the same formula and lack originality, making them predictable and uninteresting. The constant reliance on foreign locations and shallow plotlines diminishes the overall quality of the films, leaving the audience unsatisfied and bored. It's a shame that the actresses' potential is wasted on such mundane and uninspired projects."
Can you elaborate on the main issues you found with this movie?,"The plot was dull, the girls were sickening and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly never heard an Italian accent.Someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There were literally no redeeming features about this film.<br /><br />I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.","The plot was dull, the characters were unlikable, and the performances fell flat. The supposed Italian lead's accent was unconvincing, making the viewing experience cringeworthy. Additionally, the praise for the male cast being cute felt unwarranted, as the film overall lacked any standout qualities. It seems like a graveyard for struggling actors, with the exception of the Olsen twins who failed to impress."
What elements of the movie made it disappointing for the reviewer?,"Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me a bit of credit. This movie was vomit worthy. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and totally pointless. Okay I understand the premise and the idea sound but, give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mothers remorse, blamed husband! Cliché yes~! Get a life! Sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I would rather watch eggs cook! No real explanation to why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious but Why? Acting deserves a What am I doing here Oscar and the cinematography a Am I just doing this for a Wage? How much did this movie make? Well this silly fool hired a copy. Enough said","The movie was described as vomit-worthy, useless, time-consuming, and a waste of energy. The plot was deemed totally pointless, filled with clichés, and lacking in real explanations for significant events. The acting was criticized, with the actors seemingly questioning their own involvement, and the cinematography was questioned for its lack of purpose. Overall, the reviewer felt the movie was a waste of time, money, and being."
Did the movie live up to its scary DVD cover?,"Okay. Look- I've seen LOTS and I do mean LOTS of these types of films. You know, the ones where the DVD cover just look SO good and scaarrryyy that you just cant WAIT to see it? Well, I got GOT again. And I'm getting' pretty tired of it. But I digress. It's pretty simple. It sucked(I know, rather juvenile) but it did. AndI SO agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing, why oh WHY did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive?Distractingly so if I may add. And the scowl she used convey unresolved pain/grief over the death of her daughter did little help. I mean, Jesus.. Oh, but the crawling-on-her-back-demon thingee was pretty neat...","Despite the scary DVD cover and a promising premise, the movie fell flat with lackluster acting, unattractive lead actress, and a storyline that failed to captivate. The attempts to convey grief and emotion by the lead actress were unconvincing, making it hard to connect with the characters. While the crawling-on-her-back demon scene was engaging, it wasn't enough to redeem the overall disappointment of the film."
What were some of the shortcomings of the movie Dark Remains?,"I'm writing this because I somehow felt being led to believe Dark Remains was a good movie. Whilst it's not the worst I've seen, it certainly isn't good.<br /><br />A Weak script, weak actors, and weak directing. Even if they can't afford big name cast, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? It was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance. The story was a cliché and poorly scripted. The special effects were minimal. The ""suspense"" tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.<br /><br />To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors' episodes. But not quite on par with quality movies yet. Dark Remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it's a poorly made one. As for anyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.","The movie Dark Remains suffered from a weak script, unimpressive actors, and subpar directing. The lead actress was plain and delivered a dull performance, making it hard for viewers to stay engaged. The storyline was cliché and poorly executed, with minimal special effects that failed to create any real impact. The repetitive suspense tricks used throughout the film felt forced and unconvincing. While Dark Remains may appeal to die-hard horror fans, for others, it's best to invest time in a more worthwhile movie."
What are some red flags to look out for when evaluating the feedback and ratings of a movie directed by Brian Avenet-Bradley?,"If you have ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are faked. TRUST ME: you will be bored! People of the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But that's not enough: They also click constantly ""no"" whenever there is a negative comment on the movie. That's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later!<br /><br />Brian Avenet-Bradley might be quite a good business man. Otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies. (Okay, they are cheap, but nevertheless.) But as a creative person, he is a complete failure.","The movie directed by Brian Avenet-Bradley is filled with shortcomings, such as bad acting, poor lighting, weak scripting, and an unsatisfactory ending. The feedback and ratings on IMDb are highly suspicious, often manipulated by the production team to overshadow genuine negative reviews. It's a tedious and unimpressive watch, making it clear that the creative aspect of the film falls short despite any potential business acumen exhibited by the director."
"What movie features filming in Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin, and other locations in the Valley?","For those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the Valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and ""film-making"". As a reminder to those that live here - locales include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was the BC firehouse; chase scenes included Moon Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1.<br /><br />Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most approachable, Matt Broderick was above us all - even back then. As far as the film goes - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who cares at this level. A nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery.<br /><br />Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the film), original name of the film was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the Old Erba's parking lot was the town square, the backyard shots were off of Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.","Despite a lackluster script and questionable acting, this film serves as a charming time capsule showcasing the beautiful coast and valley scenery."
How did the director manage to create such an unwatchable film despite being experienced and talented?,"Quite possibly. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least when sticking to his native France), managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern. It's not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit: it's genuinely physically painful to watch, such an endless parade of inept writing, acting and film-making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced - and talented - filmmakers. For once the near-eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical release tells the whole story. What were they thinking?","It's shocking how the characters are so unlikeable, the film lacks any wit, and the overall quality of writing, acting, and filmmaking is inept. It's physically painful to watch this movie, which spent too long in the cutting room before its rushed theatrical release."
"What aspects of the movie failed to make sense to the reviewer, leading to their disappointment with the film?","A short review but...<br /><br />Avoid at all costs, a thorough waste of 90mins. At the end of the film I was none the wiser as to what had actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense. Whether the story just got lost in the edit I don't now but jeez...<br /><br />Put on a DVD instead or go to bed and get some rest!!!<br /><br />2 out of 10 (for the cameos and a Morris Minor car chase)<br /><br />","The film was described as a thorough waste of 90 minutes, leaving the viewer confused about the events that took place. The abundance of cameos did little to improve the overall coherence of the story, with recognizable faces failing to salvage the nonsensical plot. The reviewer suggested opting for watching a DVD or getting rest instead of enduring this lackluster movie experience."
What did you think of the overall production quality of the movie?,"This is an amateur movie shot on video, not an ""electrifying drama"" as the DVD liner notes falsely boast. I have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with a proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English, e.g., ""Where you go now?"" To say the production quality is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared away yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.","The overall production quality of the movie is subpar, with amateurish editing and questionable English subtitles. The use of multiple cameras and rough editing techniques detract from the viewing experience, making it fall short of professional standards."
What did you think of the movie's storyline and special effects?,"This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of ""Voyage to the Earth's Core"" and ""Mysterious Island"". I was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp ""Ogar"" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in ""People that Time Forgot"". Don't waste your time.","The movie disappointed with its silly story and noticeable special effects flaws, making it feel like a childish comic book adaptation."
"Can you please share a negative review of the film ""The Return""?","Having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80% of that time in complete disbelief, I can give this garbage the turkey of the year award, no problem. To say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement. Frankly I am lost for words to describe this utter tripe. Not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality (this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of 'serial killer flicks')but the acting was dire. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who were paid to do this, I hope you GIVE your money back. Believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much, much better. Go see.","The storyline was extremely predictable, with cliched characters and lackluster acting that made it hard to stay engaged throughout the movie. The plot twists were unconvincing and left much to be desired, making the overall viewing experience quite disappointing."
What aspects of the movie seem to fall short according to the reviewer?,"Wow, i'm a huge Henry VIII/Tudor era fan and, well, this was .... interesting. The only one I watched was the Catherine of Aragon one. And wow...just wow. I've seen bad acting before, but this reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine was umm.. crying? she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times... many, many times .... funny, funny stuff. The only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn (i might be prejudiced though, i do have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was a really facinating woman, read up on her, it's worth it!) Also, i have read a lot about the Tudor time period and i think that the characters weren't very acurately displayed, they were all very stereotypical. Only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period, and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock.","The reviewer found the acting in the movie to be subpar, particularly highlighting poor performances during emotional scenes. They also criticized the lack of accuracy in portraying the characters from the Tudor time period, stating that they were depicted in a stereotypical manner. The reviewer concluded by warning potential viewers that the film turned the lives of historically significant figures into a mockery."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find appealing at the beginning?,"The beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor, but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal.<br /><br />One of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted, with too little contrast. It doesn't look good, at least on VHS. Once in a while it breaks out and looks great, but not often Also, the characters come and go too quickly. For example, I would have liked to have seen more of ""Moby Dick."" When the film starts to drag, however, it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong. <br /><br />Overall, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years.","The reviewer found the beginning of the movie excellent with tremendous sound and nice humor, but once the film transitions into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. The muted colors and lack of contrast in the animation, as well as characters appearing and disappearing too quickly, impacted the overall viewing experience. The reviewer also felt that the film was not memorable enough to compete with other great animated films."
What are some memorable scenes and actors in the movie?,"About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch it over and over and over. But now... I don't. Actually, I think this movie would have been great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a bunch of comment-heavy actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg), and a pretty cheesy plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says, ""Hey, Tyler! Where ya goin'? The MOON??"" Also look out for the classic line, ""Do you have feeling in your toes?""<br /><br />On the other hand, it's better than ""The Good Son"".","The movie features a star-studded cast including Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, and Whoopi Goldberg. One of the standout scenes is when Culkin's character encounters a gang member who delivers a cheesy line, ""Hey, Tyler! Where ya goin'? The MOON??"" Additionally, there's a classic line asking, ""Do you have feeling in your toes?"" However, the movie's overall cheesiness and plot may make it a candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000."
"What is the main theme of the movie, and how does the character of Richard Tyler evolve throughout the story?","Richard Tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything. He doesn't like riding his bike or climbing on his tree house because he knows what kind of accidents might happen to him. So one day he is riding his bike and because it is starting to rain, he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining. In there the whole story takes place. He experiences all kinds of staff and in the end he is not scared any more. But the whole story is unbelievable and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make the story better than it is.","The storyline is quite unbelievable and lacks depth, even talented actors like Macaulay Culkin are unable to elevate the mediocre script."
Did this movie successfully encourage American kids to read?,"""I'm a cartoon!"" ""You're an illustration!"" what does that suppose to mean?! This plot could not be worse as a boy, who's afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library. The only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage American kids to read, when a cheaper, and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin(as the kid), Christopher Lloyd (as the so predictable ""that he's a the Page Master"" librarian), could save this pointless film from the dull plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart,(even) Leonard Nimoy, or the Hollywood God of voices, Frank Welker as the cartoon characters don't save it ever. I can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the Water Babies, because the bland animation makes the film worse, not improving the dull plot!","The plot of this film was uninteresting and lacked depth, relying on a simplistic message about bravery being gained through reading. Despite the talented voice cast including Macaulay Culkin and Christopher Lloyd, the bland animation and dull storyline made it a forgettable and ineffective attempt at promoting literacy among children."
"What did you enjoy about the special effects and animation in ""The Pagemaster""?","There is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is ""the Pagemaster"".<br /><br />I found this out when I watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember hating it with a passion when it first came out, but this time, I found that the special effects are quite good. The plot is just ""the Neverending Story"" with a creativity-endectomy, but it's an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye-candy. The animation is amazing, and I especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm. I'm giving it a grade of three as I *would* have given it a two (just for parody value) if I had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story-wise.","The special effects and animation in ""The Pagemaster"" were quite good, offering some really awesome eye-candy. The animators allowed the characters to look and act more surrealistic than the norm, making the film visually appealing. While the plot may lack creativity and resemble ""the Neverending Story"", the animation adds value to the movie."
Can you explain why the film lacks quality in both direction and acting?,"I was at this film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. Rarely has a film been so poorly directed (why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes?), wretchedly acted (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional gamut from A to B. He parks at A and brings a lunch) and utterly pointless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. At long last, the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that's supposed to ""really make you think."" Unfortunately, what it makes you think is, ""Well, there's 90 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.""","The film was poorly directed with random frames being cut out, and the acting was wretchedly bad. David Arquette's performance was subpar, with characters behaving unrealistically just to drive the plot forward. At the end, the film's attempt at a thought-provoking conclusion falls flat, leaving the audience feeling like they wasted their time."
"What are some of the flaws in the movie ""Adrenaline""?","Unbelievably bad acting, a no good, unclear story and flashy images and slow-motions where they are needed the least: Adrenaline is everything a movie should not be.<br /><br />Georgina Verbaan (a so-and-so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her English classes) plays rich girl Freya, who has the habit of 'thrill-seeking'. Which basicly is doing dangerous stunts, break stuff and annoy people. And not in a fun Jackass way. Then there's Dracko (Rivas). He kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there's Freya's dad (Lockyer), who plays a dubious role as well. And, in the end, we got Jason (debutant Fyall), the boyfriend of Freya.<br /><br />One day, Freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we, the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable, and the story doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />Why was this even made? 2/10.","The acting in the movie is unbelievably bad, the story is unclear, and the characters are unlikable and not believable. The movie tries to incorporate flashy images and slow-motion unnecessarily, making it a total miss with a rating of 2/10."
What did you think of the movie's classification as a comedy/drama/romance?,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not just the story, but the acting is shockingly bad. The dialog sounds like someone reading the news.<br /><br />This is rated as comedy/drama/romance, it's not of those things ! It's a little action, that's it. There's really NO comedy and drama at all.<br /><br />If you went to the cinema to see this I feel sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better. This is pretty much a action/crime movie. The actions scenes sucked, and crime story part of it was very predictable.<br /><br />If you are not really interested in a good story, or good acting. And you simply want to look at a 'foreign' film for the appeal of being foreign. Then this might be for you.","The movie was not amusing or emotional in any way, and it definitely did not have any romantic elements to it. It was mainly focused on action, but even those scenes were poorly executed and lacked excitement. The crime storyline was cliché and easy to predict."
Can you elaborate on what makes this movie such a disappointment?,"I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to. This movie made me angrier and angrier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters (""The highway belongs to me...ME!""), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the ""plot"", but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road. Blech.","This movie was a complete mess from start to finish. The storyline was confusing and hard to follow, leaving me frustrated and disconnected from the characters. The violence and nudity felt forced and added nothing of value to the movie, making it feel cheap and exploitative. Overall, watching this film was a painful experience that I would not wish on my worst enemy."
Can you describe a movie that disappointed you recently?,"I had the distinct misfortune of catching up on two of 2004's worst films back to back this morning: first, the incoherent CGI-driven emptiness of The Chronicles of Riddick, and then, the embarrassing vanity project known as Greendale. One cost multimillions and the other cost pennies, but they're both bad. Really, really bad. <br /><br />Up front I should state I'm not the world's biggest Neil Young fan, but he has contributed his share of classic tunes: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest, and Mirror Ball, the man has penned some really great songs. Sadly, there are no great songs in Greendale, and precious few good ones, and the film around which they are built is truly cringeworthy and simplistic political sloganeering. Completely without merit as art and unimpressive as polemic, Greendale is best left forgotten. Buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to Young's bank account.","The movie Greendale was a complete letdown and a waste of time. The songs were lackluster, the storyline was cringeworthy, and the entire film felt like a simplistic attempt at pushing political agendas. It's best to steer clear of this one and spend your time on something more worthwhile."
What are some major flaws in the movie highlighted by this review?,"My commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. In fact, they're quite congruent with mine. What gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie, it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to Young song to the heroine, who is unaware of what's taken place. Somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the West Coast in search of????? Sorry Neal, stick with music and leave film making to Steven Stills.","The reviewer criticized the film for lacking a coherent story, motive, and dialogue, describing it as stupid and devoid of any meaningful narrative. They also pointed out a scene involving the Devil and a hero mouthing Neil Young songs as childish and nonsensical."
Can you elaborate on why the movie was disappointing and lacked coherence in the plot?,"I give this movie a 3 as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper 2. It does not make sense to you? Well, it doesn't have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) battle a space race of moron vampires.<br /><br />Does it get any uglier than this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies, he has acted in 164 movies at this date!! It's true that he was rarely in a major role, but still!",This movie got a low rating of 3 because it falls short compared to cult classics. The plot is described as incredibly idiotic where space cowboys battle moron vampires. The only redeeming quality mentioned was Natassia Malthe's beauty. The reviewers expressed a wish for the talented actors like Michael Ironside to choose better movie roles.
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer appreciate despite its low quality and questionable production value?<br /><br />,"If it were not for the ""Oh So Gourgous,"" Natassia Malthe, this B- movie would not have been worth one sector of my Tivo disk space! In what low rent, back lot warehouse was the supposed space port filmed in? ""Continuity People!"" It's a basic principle in real movie making! By night an alleged space port and by day (night and day on a space station?) a warehouse!??!? People Please! The only thing I will commend this movie for, is the wardrobe dept. for continuously, keeping Natassia in those tight shape revealing outfits! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into, each day of filming! The Sci-fi channel would have been better off showing SpaceBalls! At least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable.<br /><br />P.S. Michael Ironside, please Fire Your Agent ASAP! You are so much better of an actor, to be even associated with this level of movie making.","Despite the questionable production quality and lackluster storyline of the movie, the reviewer appreciated Natassia Malthe's alluring presence and the wardrobe department's efforts in keeping her in appealing outfits throughout."
Would you recommend watching the movie 'Vampires vs. Humans'?,"#1 Vampires vs. Humans<br /><br />#2 Military-reject roughneck squad as first responders to dangerous, unknown Vampire incursions.<br /><br />#3 Sexy female Vampire on the side of the ""good guys"".<br /><br />#4 Plenty of gore and action.<br /><br />There are four (4) major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then the next plot device may not deter you...<br /><br />#5 In outer space.<br /><br />That last one almost got me too, but I'm glad I watched. In a pile of terrible direct-to-video horror that is the Sci-Fi channel Halloween marathon... this movie is a breath of fresh air. It will stand-up against any of the other Sci-Fi channel offerings, and even against the other Vampire movie Natassia starred in (who keeps giving Uwe Boll money?).","The movie 'Vampires vs. Humans' offers an action-packed and gory experience with a unique twist of having a sexy female Vampire on the side of the ""good guys"". Set in outer space, this film stands out among typical Sci-Fi channel offerings and provides a refreshing break from other low-quality horror movies."
"Was the movie ""Bloodsuckers"" engaging throughout or did it have dull moments?","Second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, This movie was pretty average. It is kinda boring in some parts but there is some good gore effects, but they're not great though. <br /><br />The movie takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which also has their own spaceship and is lead by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman being played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN later meets up with the leader of the vampires Muco, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans of living peacefully with humans, as he is bent on world domination. <br /><br />While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll be putting back in the DVD player anytime soon.","While the movie ""Bloodsuckers"" had some good gore effects, it was overall considered average and at times boring. The plot, set in the year 2210, revolves around a world dominated by vampires and the V-SAN Squad's efforts to combat them. Despite the presence of some interesting characters, the film failed to captivate the audience consistently, making it unlikely for viewers to revisit it frequently."
What are the main drawbacks of this movie according to the reviewer?,"I think Micheal Ironsides acting career must be over, if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap. Surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish.<br /><br />This movie could be far better, if it had a good budget, but it shows repeatedly through-out the movie. There is one scene at a outpost, which looks like, its outside the front of a railway station, and i bet it was.<br /><br />There is one scene which made give this movie a 3, and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake, surrounded by forests. This was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it.<br /><br />There is another scene, which looks like a engineering plant, which i bet it, and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it is.<br /><br />This movie is stupid, has a serious low budget, makes no sense and God Help Micheal Ironsides.","The reviewer criticizes the low budget of the film, pointing out locations that poorly represent space settings, and expresses disappointment in Michael Ironside's involvement in the movie. The reviewer mentions that the special effects in one scene were well done but overall, labels the film as stupid and nonsensical."
What makes this movie a disappointment?,"Whoo-boy, that was definitely one of the worst flicks I've seen all summer. Granted, it was on Sci Fi, and I don't watch much Sci Fi, but man, talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the max.<br /><br />The characters were stereotypical and overdone, the plot and setting were unbelievable, the vampires were less intimidating, more funny-looking, the gore was unnecessary, the special effects were down-right horrible, and the ending? Well, the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire, which, by the way, isn't really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds, in which you're closer to ""What the hell?"" then ""Man, that's hot."" If this ever appears in reruns, God forbid, DON'T WATCH IT.","The movie had a razor-thin plot with two-dimensional characters, stereotypical and overdone characterizations, unbelievable plot and setting, comically unimposing vampires, unnecessary gore, terrible special effects, and a bizarre and unenticing ending involving sudden lesbian behavior without adding any value to the story. It was an overall disappointment best avoided, despite airing on Sci Fi."
Do you think the movie effectively portrays vampires in a unique way?,"I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (as the vampiress Quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this movie.<br /><br />Certainly there is very little logic to this movie, but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flicks. The movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable, but ridiculous.<br /><br />There is too much gore and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me feel sick. A good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood -- we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he/she is going to do what a vampire will do. A few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene (like the one at end when Quintana tries to sexually arouse Rosa, all it needs is a few moans, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.","The movie lacks logic and seems to overly focus on gore and graphic scenes, detracting from a more sensible and enjoyable vampire storyline."
What were some disappointing aspects of the movie according to the review?,"Well, this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more 'adult oriented' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-Disney Channel type mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent. The movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget. There was one very cute moment which I'll just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner. The laughs are very few and far between. The end surprise for ""Mr. Fix It"" is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else. Might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or TV but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie.","The movie quickly went downhill from the initial funny moments, transitioning into a cheesy Disney Channel-like vibe with a prolonged go-kart racing scene. The lead actress's Italian accent felt forced, and the overall production seemed low-budget. The humor fell flat with very few genuine laughs, and the ending twist for ""Mr. Fix It"" was more infuriating than surprising. Not worth buying or renting, perhaps only worth a watch for free on TV."
"What are some of the shortcomings of the movie ""Mr. Fix It""?","I was eager to see ""Mr. Fix It"" because I'm a huge David Boreanaz fan. What I got, though, was a 1-1/2 hour nap. The premise seemed enjoyable: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, proprietor of a business called ""Mr. Fix It"", where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back.<br /><br />Among the problems with this movie are the editing, script, and acting. Although I've found Boreanaz delightful in his other film roles (with the exception of that ""Crow"" movie he did), this was disappointing. At times, his character was interesting and others, flat. The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players. I realize it wasn't a big-budget film, but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right.<br /><br />My advice: watch at your own risk.","I was eager to see ""Mr. Fix It"" because I'm a huge David Boreanaz fan.

What are some shortcomings of this movie according to the reviewer?,"Complete waste of time.... This movie is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not romance...not even teenage comedy at least!!! Story... it should be some turn-over one end... but it's so disappointing! When movie has a turn-over on end I expect that turn-over to make movie even better (exp. ""Fight Club"") but this turn-over makes movie even worse.... When I watch teenage comedy, and I don't do that very often, I expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness... Jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity... You got only one....very good looking I must admit... girl, and that's that! And she's fully dressed whole movie! Acting is bad... like soap series... Don't waste your time! There are porns with better story and acting!<br /><br />(sorry on my bad English)","The movie was described as a complete waste of time, lacking in comedy, drama, and romance elements. The reviewer also criticized the disappointing storyline, poor acting similar to a soap opera, and the absence of expected lousy jokes and nudity in a teenage comedy. The reviewer suggested that even adult films had better storytelling and acting compared to this movie."
What aspects of the movie do you think make it a copy of Resident Evil?,"If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil movie, then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you'll never get back. I can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of RE. First, a ""special"" commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an AI and holographic projection. And this ""Hive"" rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time. There's even a chess reference in the code names, which was in the dialog of RE. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the ""Rook"", the movie's nemesis, is some sort of bio-creature, very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of RE. So, a wag-of-the-finger to Mr. Richard Taylor for claiming any credit for this story.<br /><br />They are not the same movie obviously, but the writer got the idea watching Resident Evil I think.","The reviewer believes that the movie is a cheap knock off of Resident Evil, with similarities in characters, plot elements, setting, and even dialogue. The absence of zombies is noted, but the antagonist being a bio-creature with cyborg components is seen as a clear mimic of Resident Evil's super mutants. The reviewer expresses disappointment in the lack of originality in the movie and criticizes the writer for not acknowledging the similarities to Resident Evil."
What are some glaring issues in the TV production being reviewed?,"A stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par (to say the least) dialogue plagues this TV production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget.<br /><br />The characters aren't believable, in their motives, actions or their professed occupations. The plot reads like a bad Dungeons and Dragons(TM) hack but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, wincing. <br /><br />Avoid it like the plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you will have better acting, dialogue and plot. Yuck.","The TV production suffers from a stuttering plot, uninteresting characters, and sub-par dialogue. The characters lack believability in their motives, actions, and occupations. The plot resembles a poor-quality Dungeons and Dragons game, riddled with continuity issues and pointless character interactions. This production falls short in several aspects, making it advisable to steer clear and opt for higher-quality shows like Dark Angel for better acting, dialogue, and plot."
What made this movie so bad in your opinion?,"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot. Aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the ""special effects"" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. The movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. You can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. It's now a running joke among my friends and I. 1 out of 10.",A movie so bad even a group of friends couldn't salvage it. It's a laughable mess that falls flat in every aspect.
Would you recommend this film to someone looking for a serious apocalypse movie?,"In this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse, the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this Grade-Z film which bares less resemblance to Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. Bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. The plot, and I use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with ""the general,"" whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter. I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor. The film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. Anyone older beware.","The movie lacks depth and fails to create a sense of urgency in the face of a zombie and vampire apocalypse. The plot feels disjointed and the characters' actions often come across as illogical. The attempt at humor falls flat, and the excessive nudity seems unnecessary."
What was disappointing about the movie's execution of its title and premise?,"Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />""worse than Scarecrow slayer.""","The movie fails to effectively showcase its title theme of zombies and vampires fighting, only featuring a couple of brief scenes of this conflict. Additionally, the ambiguity surrounding the main character being a vampire leaves viewers confused and unsatisfied. The majority of the film takes place in a car, further adding to the lackluster atmosphere. The absence of a clear antagonist and a confusing ending make the last 30 minutes feel like a jumbled mess."
What are some major flaws in the film?,"Dear me. Where do I start? The dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's dad. He corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film. The favoured exclamation in this film is ""Jesus Christ!!!"". Zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between. Motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People 'rush' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH. The world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days. Breasts appear for the sake of breasts. Normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity. There's a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood that turns the stomach. The General and his catchphrase of ""Shut the f**k up!"" is the only redeeming feature. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves.","The dad and daughter don't seem believably related, the storyline lacks coherence, zombies are portrayed inconsistently, and gratuitous nudity adds no value to the movie. The general's character is the only slightly positive element amidst a mess of uninteresting and stomach-turning scenes."
Can you think of a movie that was a complete waste of time and lacked any coherent plot?,"I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no Idea what I was getting myself into.<br /><br />I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture.<br /><br />I finally know what hell is like. It's this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. It didn't even really have a plot. There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens.<br /><br />Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can. You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie.<br /><br />Don't even watch it. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you watch it, then it means they win.","This movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish. I was hoping for a classic zombie movie experience, but instead, I was subjected to pure agony and confusion. It felt like enduring visual torture with no escape in sight. The movie seemed to have scenes thrown in randomly without any explanation or overall storyline. Watching this film was like descending into cinematic hell, and I would strongly advise against wasting your time on it."
Would you recommend this movie to others?,"As myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we couldn't resist getting out a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled! However for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of Freddy Vs Jason this is a disgrace! The worst film I have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through it!<br /><br />The acting is awful the effects...well I could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck, hands etc. No story line, weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script!<br /><br />""you broke my tooth!"" from one vampire ""you broke my cigar"" was the response from the human who looked like uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Santa!","The reviewer found the movie to be a disgrace, labeling it as the worst film they have ever seen. They criticized the acting, effects, lack of storyline, weird flashbacks, and terrible script. The reviewer also highlighted a bizarre and unconvincing dialogue exchange between a vampire and a human character."
",",This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen!! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I have seen some bad movies but this one takes it. There is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it. I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half. Please take my advice and DO NOT WATCH this movie for I know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life.,
What aspects of the vampire myth does this movie go against?,"Well...the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. Like vampires that walk in the sunlight. Though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies. A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ""Ow this hurts...It's really stuck."" Then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while. And there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot. Come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as i write more of this I like this movie more. But you know, all in all you can't expect Schindlers List but its a fun watch.","The movie was entertaining to watch, but it deviates from traditional vampire lore by showing vampires in sunlight. The film also features scenes that feel disjointed or out of place, such as random dream sequences that don't contribute to the plot. Despite the lack of coherence, watching the movie with friends and giving it a second viewing enhanced the enjoyment. However, the fight scenes were poorly done and the zombies were the only engaging part. Overall, the movie may be enjoyable for a casual watch, but it lacks depth and cohesion."
Can you tell me more about the overall feel of this film?,"OK, look at the title of this film.<br /><br />the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.<br /><br />well, sadly, you won't see any of that.<br /><br />just a bunch of bad actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.<br /><br />oh, well, i think there are about 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed...<br /><br />get away from this if you want to see a good movie. else get it.","The title of this film builds up a lot of anticipation, but unfortunately, the movie fails to deliver on its promises. The actors are subpar, the storyline revolves around superficial elements like blood, hot chicks, and unnecessary subplot involving lesbians. The zombies and vampires make brief appearances, but overall, this film is not worth your time if you're looking for quality content."
Can you describe your overall experience watching the movie?,"I though this would be an okay movie, since i like zombies and horror movies in general. But i did not think it would be such a piece of sh!t like it was. The only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car!!! The movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors, i wouldn't ever call them actors! The costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play. Its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters. There is no fun at all in this piece of sh!t, only horror, but not in the way the director intended. I would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again!!! ugh!",
Can you identify any redeeming qualities of this film?,"I read the reviews before i watched this movie, and i didn't believe them. I love crap movies and i expected this one to be average. It wasn't. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats. The film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off. even the nudity was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this film? I don't think they did. You can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes. if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood. Avoid this trash - I watched it on TV and felt riped off, so don't spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.","The film has unfortunately fallen flat in almost every aspect, from the bad acting to the poor sound quality and confusing storyline. Even the supposedly entertaining elements like nudity were disappointing. Overall, it's best to avoid spending any money on this film as it might leave you feeling ripped off."
What made this film a disappointment for the audience?,"This film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits. Hah what good bits? the only bit that was worth it was the ending (those who have seen the film will know what i mean). I expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs. Jason but what i got was this crap. Story was forgettable, the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this. This could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched. OK so what if there was a nice bit of T and A, I was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed. Don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie SHOULDN'T BE DONE.","The film was a major letdown for viewers who eagerly anticipated an exciting blend of different horror genres. Instead of the promised action-packed combination of underworld, zombies, and iconic horror villains, the movie turned out to be a bore-fest with a forgettable story. The cast was underutilized, and the director's choices left viewers scratching their heads. Despite a sprinkling of titillation, the lack of graphic violence left fans of gore feeling unsatisfied. Ultimately, this film failed to live up to expectations and served as a prime example of how not to make a horror movie."
Can you explain what made the first few scenes of the movie so hilarious?,"I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago, I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity. The first few scenes alone were hilarious. I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it, I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs. Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing. Towards the end we all got bored however, as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten ""Learn to Read"" book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.","The movie lacks a coherent plot, the acting is subpar, and the characters are poorly developed. The initial humor fades quickly, leaving the audience feeling bored and unimpressed. Additionally, even a potentially engaging scene like a lesbian sex scene falls flat and becomes uninteresting."
What were some redeeming qualities of the movie that managed to salvage a positive viewing experience for some audience members?,"This movie should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore, this movie is a complete waste of time. Calling it ""Campy"" doesn't even cut it. ""Campy"" implies fun which this movie was not. You spend the first half of the movie thinking ""Its got to get better, right?"". In fairness, it does, at the very end when its finally explained who the ""brother/sister"" team are and what they want but by then, you hardly care anymore because you've spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did Mr. Onorati & Ms. Pacula do to tick someone off THIS badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie.<br /><br />",
"Can you provide a negative review of the movie focusing on the poor acting, failed attempts at humor, and predictability?","After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor---much worse than the acting in 80s T&A movies.<br /><br />There are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal, but for those that have seen many movies, you will know how the film turns out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this.","The acting in this movie is subpar, making it feel more like a cheesy 80s movie rather than a modern rom-com. The attempts at humor fall flat, leaving you cringing instead of laughing. The plot is completely predictable, giving no surprises or twists to keep the viewer engaged. If you're looking for a movie with depth and entertainment value, this is not the one to watch."
What made this film so unbearable to watch?,"A film as bad as this should be withdrawn from all stores world wide. So full of boring, dull, unimaginative characters, and with a lead character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly giving a thoughtless voice over for every action and feeling, this film holds the record for the most challenging film I have ever watched. As I had payed money to own it, I felt a duty to see it through, and how I regret it. My head hurt throughout because of the terribly dull characters and their pointless, plot less lives. A bunch of kids who have zero knowledge about anything, are all frigid and worst of all, have terrible dialogue throughout, just mulling around as the main character tries to get a date with the girl. Boring, so much so my friend was shaking with hatred and I was red with embarrassment that I'd thrown away £6. The DVD was on eBay the following day, and I didn't make much of my money back. Avoid like the plague.","The film was full of boring, dull, and unimaginative characters with a lead character who had an annoying attitude and a dry voice that constantly provided a thoughtless voice-over for every action and feeling. The plot was pointless, the dialogue was awful, and the characters had zero knowledge about anything. It was so boring that my friend was shaking with hatred and I was red with embarrassment for wasting money on it. Avoid this film at all costs."
What makes this thriller a disappointment according to the review?,"Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller directed by Amenabar's usual collaborator Mateo Gil. The film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills, actually delivers none, and seems like an exercise in boredom. The only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100-plus minutes, and is resolved too simply. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. If you're fans of the genre, watch ""Tesis"" instead.","The review criticizes the slow pace, lack of thrills, and overall boredom of the movie. It highlights the climax as the only slightly suspenseful moment in the unnecessarily long film, with a resolution that feels too simplistic. The plot is described as lacking sophistication and credibility, with characters who lack initiative or resourcefulness. The review suggests watching ""Tesis"" instead for fans of the genre."
Did this movie properly depict the seriousness of war?,"Although the beginning suggests All Quiet on the Western Front, this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary. This depicts the funnest war ever fought, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times.<br /><br />When we finally see some battle, it is lame: An enemy plane flies over? Shoot it down (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he gets a shot off. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Not to worry, they gladly surrender. Ho-hum.<br /><br />Tepid, turgid, predictable...<br /><br />","No, this movie failed to capture the true essence of war and instead focused on portraying it as a fun and easygoing experience. The battle scenes were lackluster and unrealistic, with little depth or intensity. The overall depiction was shallow, unconvincing, and highly disappointing."
What are some aspects of the movie that viewers found disappointing or lacking?,Absolutely horrific film. Ameteurish and it isn't funny at all. Lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Edits by E.T and star wars is just plain stupid.<br /><br />Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good think about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Other than Goksal this movie is a garbage.<br /><br />Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date.<br /><br />Music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also have some presence. Actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever.,"The film is generally considered to be amateurish, lacking humor, and the lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is described as very annoying. The editing, particularly the mix of E.T and Star Wars elements, is deemed to be plain stupid. The only redeeming qualities mentioned are actor Yilmaz Goksal, his potential for Hollywood, the music by Cem Karaca, and some presence shown by actor Sumer Tilmac."
Was the movie able to deliver on its promise to captivate the audience with its thrilling storyline and strong performances?,"While channel surfing, we found this movie with its promising synopsis. We were dismayed at the flat acting, and formulaic storyline. We found amusing the exploding car scenes, unbelievable shoot outs, and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from ""Dante's Peak"", where the church front falls on the school bus, the store fronts break away from the main street, the overpass collapsing, and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it. It was a good laugh although unintended, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films.","The movie offered little in terms of acting depth, relying on predictable plot twists and over-the-top action scenes. The visual effects appeared cheap and recycled from other disaster films, undermining the overall viewing experience."
What are some of the drawbacks of the movie?,"Two days after seeing this thing, I'm still in agony over HAVING seen it. It's so bad, you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe, much less allow it to be loose on the general public. Stilted acting, a leading man who looks like he's sleepwalking, and Alison Eastwood embarrassing herself. The action is indicative of low budget movie making, which means it is painfully bad. The plot? Well, if you were 6 years old, then you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic, and just plain lame.","The movie is a painful watch due to stilted acting, a leading man who appears disinterested, and Alison Eastwood's cringeworthy performance. The low-budget action scenes are poorly executed, and the simplistic, idealistic plot is unimpressive, even likened to something a 6-year-old could have written."
Can you provide a negative review based on the positive reviews of the movie?,"My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />From the get-go, this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera, and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes, such as the ""Big one"" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? The earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it butchered and slapped in. I can't believe how poorly this movie was done, ""borrowing"" scenes from other, much better films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA, ala Dante's Peak.<br /><br />My advise, forget the Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this film and go for the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.)<br /><br />","The movie seemed like a poorly done soap opera, with scenes butchered and slapped in from better films like Dante's Peak. The director's attempt to fool viewers into believing wooded mountain backdrops exist in downtown L.A. fell flat. The Bond wannabe character, Nash, failed to make an impact, making it disappointing and unoriginal."
"What are the major flaws in the movie ""Power Play"" that make it unenjoyable?","""Power Play"" starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell, ""Power Play"" has no redeeming value or interest. ""Power Play"" has more earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play. It's awful, simply awful.<br /><br />Bottom line, if ""Power Play"" was made in the 60's or 70's it would be considered a poor ""B"" class movie. The fact that ""Power Play"" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there such a thing as a ""D"" class movie? If so, ""Power Play"" casts the mold.","The only standout actor is Tobin Bell in a small role, with the rest of the cast failing to impress. The numerous earthquake scenes are unrealistic and the action sequences are amateurish, resembling a children's school play. Overall, ""Power Play"" lacks redeeming qualities and falls below the standards of a mediocre film, making it a disappointing watch."
What elements of the film did the reviewer find particularly cringeworthy and unbearable?,"I have to finish watching a movie once I start, regardless of how bad it is. This movie was agonizing to sit through. The ""sparkling"" bullets, the reporter with ""ninja"" like moves, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders, the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible. Like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from ""what the heck are you doing in here (holding a bat)"" to ""hey, you're cute, wanna @#$%!???"" in like 1.2 seconds.... Just bad.... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dog)!","The movie was painful to endure due to its unrealistic features such as the""sparkling"" bullets, reporter with extraordinary ninja skills, and bad guys conveniently missing their targets. The predictable plot, unconvincing acting, and absurd character interactions further contributed to this agonizing experience. The abrupt and implausible behavior of characters like the sudden romantic interest made the entire storyline feel artificial and awkward. The reviewer strongly advises skipping this movie and suggests investing time in more worthwhile activities, like spending time with loved ones or pets."
What are some common criticisms of the movie's script and production quality?,"I think if they made ANY MONEY make a complete turd bomb like this one. The I need to get into the movie industry. I wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and made a better script once. Watch when the guy is running through the tunnel, they used the same 30 feet of tunnel OVER and OVER and OVER again and never even changed the location of the stupid HANGING light.<br /><br />I think if i get the THRILL of meeting the director of this GEM of a MOVIE, I think i will pick a fight with him and start it by deficating on his LOAFERS<br /><br />I think I need to puke now","Many viewers found the script to be terrible and equated it to something they could have written on a piece of toilet paper. The repetitive use of a small section of tunnel in the movie was also pointed out as a major flaw, with the hanging light never moving from its location."
What makes this movie so disappointing and bad to watch?,Can only be described as awful. It is bad to start with and then gets even more bad. When you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but fear not because it does. Another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie stars. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both. As for the hero - well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it. And in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete - doesn't even blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies. This is a really ridiculous movie. Lucky it only cost me $1 to hire.,"This movie has been described as awful from start to finish. The script is poorly written, the acting is subpar, and the directing is lackluster. The hero's actions defy logic and common sense, making the whole movie feel ridiculous and unbelievable. It is truly a waste of time and money."
What are some of the shortcomings of the movie?,"Okay, the story makes no sense, the characters lack any dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie, the cinematography is dismal, and only editing saves a bit of the muddle, but Sam"" Peckinpah directed the film. Somehow, his direction is not enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a disappointment. Even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.<br /><br />The proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch the great Peckinpah films. Skip this mess.","The story doesn't make sense, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue lacks depth, the cinematography is poor, and even with Sam Peckinpah directing, it falls short. Despite a talented cast, the movie is a disappointment and not worth the viewer's time."
What aspects of the movie do you think contributed to it being labeled as one of the worst films ever seen?,"Another too bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise this would get an easy zero. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact were Peckenpah's name not on the thing I would never have guessed he did it. Actually one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that Sam was just plain snockered. It shows in spades. The laughing bit at the early part of the film is the ONLY thing in this entire mess worth a second look. Not even Gig Young is watchable. This is a true test of masochism. Had I been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it I would have jumped up screaming. And now I truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than made up as they went along. It's not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards. Yikes!!!!!","This movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. It seemed like the actors were not even trying and the storytelling was incoherent. Even the presence of a seasoned actor like Gig Young couldn't save this train wreck of a film. The lack of direction and substance made it painful to sit through, and it felt like a chaotic mess that was thrown together without any thought. The overall experience was so unbearable that it left a lasting impression as one of the worst movies ever made."
What were some disappointing aspects of the movie?,"This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!<br /><br />The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will end up in the Dead Movie Office soon.","The movie started off promising with humor and charm, but quickly became dull and predictable. The characters shifted from being delightful to unrealistic caricatures, and the dialogue felt stale. The storyline was unoriginal and the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, making it hard to invest in the film."
"What are the major drawbacks of the film ""Dead Letter Office""?","'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. Overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.","The film ""Dead Letter Office"" suffers from poor acting, a lack of believability in the portrayal of the office environment, and a disconnect between the characters' past and present situations. The film's attempt at portraying real-life struggles falls flat due to its unrealistic depiction and overall lack of convincing details."
What were some aspects of the movie that didn't live up to expectations based on the review?,"this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen. i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? its more like a lumbering drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs. the movie had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them. they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant. this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different.","The movie was criticized for not delivering on its promise as a horror movie or a thriller, and instead was labeled as a lumbering drama. Despite having great scary music, it was used inappropriately in mundane situations. The film also failed to properly introduce its interesting characters and left viewers confused about their actions and motives."
What movie is being described in the review?,"The bad news is it's still really dreadful. I gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funny.<br /><br />It's supposed to be better than ""Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker"", and progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I was drinking heavily when I watched it and felt generous. Whatever, ""2"" it is.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty quick. It takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II's key themes and fight scenes, hacks them up, dumbs them way down, dirties up the dialog, and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video.<br /><br />You'd best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one. And get this DVD back to the video store on time! You'll really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.","The reviewer gave it a low rating of 2, mentioning that it's dreadful with some occasional funny moments. The film is criticized for being amateurish and a poor attempt at parody, mashed up with elements from Kill Bill I & II. The reviewer implies that one would need to be heavily intoxicated to find any enjoyment from this movie and warns against late fees for returning the DVD."
What were some key criticisms of the movie?,"This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she wouldn't live in some commune with him (he was mad that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Right then and there I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic that countered Archie Bunker's right winged philosophies? The series went on, but it just didn't have any pizazz. Whatever momentum Sally Struthers gained from All the Family was long gone. Maybe, if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of All In The Family, it might have worked out. Ah well, that's show business.","The character developments were weak and seemed inconsistent with their past personas, causing a lack of engagement from the audience."
What famous personality was involved in narrating the film and what is the film about?,"Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed on this. How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train wreck? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it obviously dated and kind of silly.<br /><br />The reenactments look like they are out of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" but without the high production values. People should have been embarrassed to take part in this.<br /><br />In short, the movie is dated, silly, reactionary, and useless. Good if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to actually look for.","The movie ""The Armageddon Prophecies"" is a dated and silly documentary that tries to link biblical prophecies to contemporary events with low production values, resulting in a reactionary and useless viewing experience. The reenactments resemble those from ""Unsolved Mysteries"" but lack quality, making the film more laughable than informative."
"What was disappointing about the film ""Carlitos Way: Rise to Power"" according to the review?","This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way(1993) is a great film. Goodgfellas it isn't but its one of the better crime films done. This movie should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe speed Zone. Remember those gems! The only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original. This movie lacked everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard on. There wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it. I hope RISE TO POWER wins every RAZZIE it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder. After I watched this S@*T FEST movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth. After watching this I wish Pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery.","The movie was considered a terrible attempt to capitalize on the original, lacking the elements that made the original film successful. The characters were unlikable, and the reviewer wished they had never seen the film."
What were some of the major flaws in the movie?,"This was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to watch it. Almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were okay, for example his dream of one day moving to the Carribien, but on the whole they were weak. The love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable. Anyways I really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations weren't met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he actually is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky though because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars. Better luck next time. And yes I did enjoy Carlito's Way.","The movie was a disappointment overall, with unmotivated actions, poor acting, and a predictable plot. The links to Carlito's Way were weak, the love interest felt wrong, and even the decent actor Jay Hernandez couldn't save it. It only gets two stars from me."
What did you think of the character development in the movie? Were the relationships and connections between the characters well portrayed?,"Wow...what can I say...First off IMDb says this is in the late 60s...which means Carlito would be very close to going to prison, He got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years. They used a bunch of nobody actors, and a story that didn't even make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and hes playing a totally different guy. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican chick? Wheres Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever...You'd think he'd have been in this one. And if this made sense, where are Rocco and the black dude in the first one? It was all just stupid...This is an insult to Pacino and the first film.","The movie felt like a complete mess. The storyline was all over the place and filled with inconsistencies. It didn't even make sense that some characters were missing or portrayed differently. The choice of relatively unknown actors didn't help elevate the film either. It was a disappointing follow-up to the original, lacking depth and respect for the established characters."
What were some misleading aspects of the advertising for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power?,"Deceptive Advertising... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power that states ""From the Producer of Scarface and Carlito's Way"" LETS GET IT STRAIGHT... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact he was 'editing room assistant' for Scarface. Not to take away from Bergman's talent... but in my opinion he should of had a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say... We hate being blatantly lied to. As far as the movie goes, It was poor at best. I did think Puff Daddy did a good job. Although, Luis Guzman should be ashamed for working on this film. Overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for Carlito's Way. It's obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film.","The movie did not live up to the expectations set by the misleading advertising. The film was considered poor and did not effectively expand on the storyline of Carlito's Way. Despite Puff Daddy's decent performance, Luis Guzman's involvement was seen as a disappointment. It was apparent that this movie was more about profit than creating a quality film."
What makes this movie stand out among other gangster films?,"If you hit your head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that hasn't been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better. Those who think ""Scarface"" was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw ""Goodfellas"", ""Menace II Society"" or ""Dead Presidents"" and thought MMM ""That's the life for me!"" will like this movie. I thought I'd give the movie a chance, since the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone above a 4th grade education, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.","The movie offers a fresh perspective on the typical gangster storyline. The characters are well-developed, and the plot twists keep the audience engaged from start to finish. The performances by the lead actors are outstanding, adding depth to the narrative. Overall, the movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre."
Do you think the casting choices in this film were appropriate?,"I have to say this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They had a pretty good storyline to go on, but than the messed it up so badly. First of all the cast is all wrong, where did that van peeble(crap actor btw) and puff daddy come from??? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood, and used to hang about with some real idiots. This film doesn't do ""Carlitos Way"" any justice. Im so happy that the sequel ""Carlito's Way"" came out first, if I had seen this rubbish first, I would have never given the pacino version a chance. And anyway, pacino is supposed to have read this story, thought it's crap and did the sequel instead. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.",
What were some of the main issues with the movie that made it difficult to enjoy?,"This was so lame that I turned the DVD off...maybe halfway through. It was so weak, I couldn't even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in I made it.Though I really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young Carlito would be somewhat different, I just couldn't buy it. I don't really blame the actors, because I think it was the script that may have fallen flat. I did find myself laughing a few times, but I don't think those lines were intended to be funny.<br /><br />It's only saving grace is that I bought it in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I did for the original alone. This is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone.","The movie was so weak that the viewer couldn't even make it halfway through before turning it off. The depiction of the young Carlito was unconvincing and the script fell flat, leading to a lackluster performance by the actors. The only redeeming quality was getting it as part of a DVD set at a discounted price."
What movie are the reviews referring to?,"this film was totally not what i expected. <br /><br />if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two. <br /><br />its really strange because i cannot see the point . the prequel and sequel lets just say don't make sense, the don't even match . maybe i am naive but ain't a vol 1 & vol 2 meant to match up. <br /><br />carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original, and in the prequel he lives and don't go jail. <br /><br />the plot was OK , but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film .<br /><br />i really expected it to end like the other one started. <br /><br />if some one has a opinion on this post it please.","This film was a major disappointment. It lacked coherence and continuity between its prequels and sequels, leaving the audience confused about the storyline. The characters' arcs were inconsistent, making it hard to follow their development. If they had changed some actors and tweaked the plot, it might have salvaged the film."
"Would you recommend this movie to fans of the original film ""Carlito's Way""?","really awful... lead actor did OK... the film, plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well... anything it had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way... and should be avoided like the plague by any Carlito's ways fans... no mention of Gail in fact he ends up with some other bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he got caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail... they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning... but to be honest when rating it I was looking for a zero mark... unfortunately I had to rate it higher...<br /><br />Its a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90's... overall it was approximately £6 and 2 hours of my life wasted... for all the ""action"" in it, it was truly boring slow and predictable... again to any Carltio's Way fans avoid this fiasco...","The film was a terrible attempt to cash in on the success of the original, with a completely inaccurate plot and lack of relevance to the original story. It was boring, slow, and predictable, wasting the viewer's time and money. Fans of ""Carlito's Way"" should avoid this fiasco."
What are the main strengths of the film?,"Quote: theurgist: Anyone with an I.Q. over 50 would have seen this film what it is, an intelligent well acted prequel to a modern day classic, yes it doesn't have a blockbuster cast or a huge budget BUT it is still very well done and had me hooked for the full duration.<br /><br />An I.Q. over 50 you say.. that most mean you have an I.Q. lower than 50.. its name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! meaning it should have something whit the first one to do.. <br /><br />all and all its a OK movie if.. YOU CHANGE THE TITLE AND NO CHARACTERS NAMED CARLITO BRIGANTE!!!<br /><br />P.s don't comment on a movie if you don't know anything about movies. but i guess an I.Q. under 50,, you wont know what the hell i am yelling about...<br /><br />Peace out!!","The movie has been praised for its intelligent storytelling, strong acting, and engaging prequel to a beloved modern classic, even with a modest budget and cast."
Can you share your thoughts on this movie?,"This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete. The one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim, was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete.<br /><br />This movie makes me want to go to the washroom. I am not a negative type of guy, but man the acting in this flick is.... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick. I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it.","This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete. The acting is subpar, and the plot failed to capture the essence of the original film. It left me feeling like I wasted my time and money."
Can you elaborate on the overall plot structure of the movie and character development?,"Soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the ""prequel"" tag. Instead this is a common theme in Hollywood, rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc.<br /><br />This film's plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball, and the character development was non-existent. I seriously felt like I was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad. P Diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time.<br /><br />The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film.<br /><br />If you are a big Carlito's Way fan, I recommend you not watch this. If you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original, because that is exactly what it did.","Soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the ""prequel"" tag. The plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball, and the character development was non-existent."
"What was the audience's reaction to ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)""?","Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)"" which went straight to DVD...no wonder .....it completely ...and I mean completely S%&KS !!! waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it.... I don't understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too bad for him I don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh#$%ty movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.","The audience reaction to ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)"" was overwhelmingly negative. One viewer expressed extreme disappointment, calling the movie a complete waste of time, criticizing the production quality, and even comparing it unfavorably to the original ""Carlito's Way."" The only praise given was for Jay Hernandez's portrayal of the young Brigante."
What makes European Vacation the weakest of the Vacation films?,"European Vacation (aka National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of the Vacation films (the first and third one the most superior of the films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue. This causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the ""jokes"" as they are, are just pasted together into a cobbled-together script), rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 Vacation films have. Oh well, they can't win them all. 4 out of 10.","European Vacation is criticized for having a weaker script with very bad dialogue, resulting in unfunny jokes and poor pacing. The lack of a cohesive central plot also contributes to the film's downfall."
What do you think about the film's attempt at creating a modern small-town American Christmas fable?,"Read on and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (was that all!).<br /><br />Unremittingly bleak, this film sets out to produce (I'm guessing) a modern small town American Christmas fable in the Capra style. If fails....completely and absolutely fails. I've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't. Let me mention some of the highlights ...<br /><br />People don't die, they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in Santa's factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /><br />And the plot.. I won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any. Even the photography is bleak - snow shown at the end of a freeze, everywhere looking cold, damp and miserable. <br /><br />As you might guess, the film has a happy (schmaltzy) ending. What a relief !","The film is described as unremittingly bleak and fails completely in achieving its goal. The plot is criticized for lacking any sense of light or contrast with the darkness portrayed throughout the movie. The imagery is also bleak, with the snow and surroundings depicted as cold, damp, and miserable. The only relief mentioned is the schmaltzy happy ending."
What are some negative aspects of the movie?,"This was the WORST Christmas movie I ever saw. I took my two small children to see this. It was the darkest, most dismal plot- family has no money, mom loses her job, father gets killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is left all alone. No wonder her Christmas spririt is gone. Christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned, and Santa does not bring back dead fathers! I thought this was the WORST message to send children. Better to tell them that there is NO Santa than show them a movie like this!!","The movie was the WORST Christmas movie with a dark and dismal plot that sends a terrible message to children by portraying the death of a father and drowning of children, completely crushing the Christmas spirit."
Can you elaborate on why the movie was so disappointing?,"My spouse & I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started out good, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially Gideon, the Angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.","The movie was criticized for starting off promisingly but quickly becoming unrealistic and ridiculous. Most of the acting was deemed poor, except for the performance of the little girl, Abbie. The dialogue was predictable and underwhelming, particularly the lines delivered by the character Gideon. Additionally, there was a lack of emotional depth in a crucial tragedy scene, leaving viewers unimpressed with the script's quality. Fans of heartwarming Hallmark movies were advised to steer clear of this film."
What genre does the movie fall under and what historical movement does it reflect?,"This one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era. Of course, that doesn't mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. It runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and is basically standard fare fluff. What I mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize. Anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste. It's the same feeling you may get after watching this. A nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I expected better things.","The movie tries to bring some humor during the women's rights movement, but ends up being lackluster and uninteresting. The attempt to switch traditional gender roles falls short and leaves the audience wanting more."
What are some of the disappointing aspects of this film according to the review?,A high school principal (Keenan Wynn) with a losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out not only to be a gorgeous blond woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but a catalyst for their new winning ways. Are you really surprised? Along the way a romance grows between the coach and the team's star player Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never notified.<br /><br />Packaged along with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie really does this film no service. This can easily be edited into a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as coach Randy Rawlings especially in her skimpy outfits but I expected more than mere titillation from an R-rated film. A side plot involving a dorky center who is hypnotized by his teammates into thinking he is former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the actual reason for the team's new success rather than Cathy Lee's coaching. Too much tease and not enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment.,"The film is criticized for relying too much on titillation rather than substance, with the romance and skimpy outfits of the coach overshadowing the actual plot development. The side plot involving hypnosis takes away from the focus on the main character and the basketball team's success. Overall, the film is deemed a major disappointment due to its lack of depth and excessive teasing."
What makes the movie unintentionally comical and convoluted in its plot?,"Seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable. It prompted me to exclaim ""Oh my God!"" more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain silly.<br /><br />Fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable, near impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they exist.<br /><br />If you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one. Otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time!<br /><br />(That a film released in 2003 is already being shown on TV in July 2003 might give an indication of the film's quality)","The movie's attempt to be a thriller falls flat, resulting in laughable scenarios and contrived plot twists that prompt exclamations of disbelief. The absurd and improbable locations, alongside the unrealistic human reactions, make it challenging to comprehend the purpose behind their existence. If you're looking for a contender for the worst picture, this could be it. Otherwise, watching paint dry might be a more productive use of your time."
"What are the main flaws of the movie ""Consequence""?","There is one good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! Sorry to be so blunt but it's the truth. Too bad she didn't do a nude. It would at least have made this mess tolerable. We see another chick's boobs but she's nowhere near Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like crap! ""Consequence"" is the usual B-Movie you would expect. The story had potential. It's like they had good ideas but didn't know how to execute them. The cinematography is just plain awful. Ugly! The directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors. Lola Gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap, slutty way but not even she saves ""Consequence"" from being trash and not funny trash, just plain old stinking trash.","The movie lacks engaging storytelling, suffers from poor cinematography, uninspired directing, and features washed-up actors. The potential in the storyline is not effectively executed, resulting in a bland thriller with lame twists. The film relies on cheap thrills and fails to deliver a compelling viewing experience."
"What were your thoughts on the movie ""Classic"" that played on H.B.O?","I was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2:00 a.m. so I flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon H.B.O. where this ""classic"" was playing. Initially I was happy to have caught something at the beginning, but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie. The whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females, four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's diner, and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner. There are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting, but certainly not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do some night or just can't sleep medication works much better. However guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound, but even that can get annoying","The reviewer found the movie uninteresting, with a focus on unattractive characters and strange story twists that didn't make it worth watching. They mentioned it might be tolerable for the skin shown, but overall recommended finding something else to do."
What makes this movie hard to watch for some viewers?,"This is one of those awful, sex-driven B-movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater. Women run around dressed in scantily clad ""bunny"" outfits, an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes, and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man, who has an oddball son (Jim Hanks, who is of course Tom's brother), whom the man wants to get ""laid."" Hanks is actually sort of good, but this movie goes nowhere and has no point. One must wonder why it was even made? Nevertheless, because of Hank's performance and a few entertaining moments(but no more than a few), it received a stellar ""2"" out of 10. I think I was being nice, though.","The movie is filled with tasteless jokes, objectification of women in revealing outfits, and a lack of direction, making it difficult for some viewers to sit through. The questionable purpose of the film and the overall feeling of pointlessness leave many wondering why it even exists."
What are some of the major flaws mentioned in the review of the movie?,"Incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous (""the horses, oh my God, the horses!"") thriller. It's creepy at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody ""magically"" does exactly what the plot needs for the ""resolution"" to occur. Bland performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.","The review highlights the muddled and off-putting nature of the film, pointing out its ludicrous plot and exceptionally poor script. It also criticizes the bland performances by the main actors, particularly calling out the video transfer for making the movie even more confusing."
Did the movie have any redeeming qualities or moments that stood out positively?,"I awake suddenly, aware that I'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize it's a warm Saturday afternoon. Why was I sleeping? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? Could it be adult onset narcolepsy? <br /><br />No, I momentarily paused on Cheap Seats while channel surfing, and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I blacked out.<br /><br />It's that head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad. But I have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive that they had on me, and when he/she woke up, a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he/she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep, no one will now how awful it is and he/she can keep the $425,000 annual salary.<br /><br />You've been warned.","The movie was described as a complete disaster, with a stunning lack of humor and talent that drained the viewer's life force. It was deemed moronic, boring, and overall awful, leaving the viewer in disbelief at how bad it was."
What type of subject matter does the film revolve around and how are these themes portrayed?,"This is yet another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I kept waiting for it to pick-up, but unfortunately it never did. The acting is fair, but the script needs A LOT of work. And if you're looking for the nudity, don't waste your time with these not so hot actors. Due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you have never seen over five gay films, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you may find this film interesting, otherwise it's your run-of-the-mill low budget movie. It ranks as one of the worst gay films I have ever seen.",
"What are some of the main issues with the casting and acting in ""The Rainmaker"" movie?","""The Rainmaker"" released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, and Burt Lancaster being the principle players. Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. Lancaster over acts to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. It seems like the 1950's was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didn't make too many of them. Despite an A-list cast and good production values, it doesn't work.","The movie, despite having a stellar cast including Katharine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster, falls short due to overacting and mismatched casting choices. Hepburn's portrayal of a shy spinster is unconvincing, Lancaster's performance is overly dramatic, and only a few actors like Lloyd Bridges manage to stand out. Overall, the film fails to deliver despite its high production values."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""The Rainmaker"" based on positive reviews?","I generally LIKE watching Burt Lancaster's films--especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed ANYTHING. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was meant to be a sort of showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She is supposed to be smart but doesn't seem so when Lancaster's blarney is being thrown about the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most stagy looking films I have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play. It just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open West like it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Overall, a very overrated film.",
What are some common criticisms of The Education of Little Tree?,"The Education of Little Tree is just not as good as it could have been. Little Tree's education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you. Whatever happened to the three R's? Readin' 'Ritin' and 'Rithmetic? When the idiot back talks the teacher at the boarding school place he starts crying and talking to the sky. Oh my gosh. Sure, the lady was a little harsh, but then James Cromwell's character comes and takes him away, leaving the audience thinking that Little Tree was absolutely right. He should learn to adapt to new discipline. Those were the times! Talking to a star is not going to change a thing! Little Tree needs to learn that his adoring guardians are not always right.","The film fails to effectively prioritize traditional education values and instead focuses on less practical spiritual and philosophical teachings for the main character, Little Tree. The portrayal of a child challenging authority figures in such a dramatic manner may come off as unrealistic to some viewers, detracting from the overall credibility of the storyline. The emphasis on unconventional methods of learning may leave audiences questioning the practicality of the young protagonist's education journey."
What are some of the major flaws in the movie Timecop?<br />,"I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1<br /><br />It's story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original Timecop. Lots of things from Timecop was scrapped, and they put in new stupid stuff instead. This story is taking place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :confused:<br /><br />And the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well most of them aren't... only the first one is great... and there aren't many action scenes at all, and they're all pretty short<br /><br />At one point in the story, the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes... no wait, make that two times...<br /><br />In short: Don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it","The story is dull, strays far from the original Timecop, and introduces unnecessary elements. The setting in 2060 doesn't align well with the increased danger of time travel. Action scenes are lackluster, with only the first being impressive. The main character's excessive time traveling within a short timeframe adds to the confusion. Overall, it's advised not to watch this movie as it lacks value."
What kind of themes and content dominate the movie?,"I simply cant understand why all these relics from the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. One can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies, and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy-fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing, and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness. THOSE people were mastering their jobs - well, you Don't! Do us a favor, all you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other obsolete old-timers, and leave us alone! Its bit time to see some Romanian MOVIES on screen, enough with your immature terribilisms! You are not directors, you are ILLITERATE!!!","The movie features excessive and unnecessary scenes of people defecating, urinating, vomiting, and swearing which are deemed unnecessary and grotesque. The reviewer criticizes the filmmakers for their lack of mastery in handling such dark themes and suggests that they are merely trying to shock audiences rather than creating meaningful cinema. The reviewer expresses a strong desire for more sophisticated and refined Romanian movies on screen instead of these crude and distasteful productions."
What is your opinion on the cinematographic quality of the movie?<br><br>,"This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE.<br /><br />The obsession of Daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare. Also, it's evident that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everybody - his country his people, his actors, his job. And this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago.<br /><br />This so called ""film"" is just a hideous string of disgusting images, with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and to good sense. Shame, shame, shame!","The movie ""doesn't seem like something with much appeal to normal audiences, as it delves into extremely distasteful themes and lacks any semblance of artistic merit. It can be described as a revolting and hateful creation that fails to uphold any level of professionalism. It ultimately comes across as an offensive and shameful piece that offers no value to viewers."
What did the reviewer dislike about the film they watched?,"Just picked up this film for a buck at National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I feel like I got ripped-off.<br /><br />I don't know that I've seen a worse film than this. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a film had I not such enormous respect for the subject matter, that is, Stephen Foster and his music.<br /><br />First, what is it? It's a musical biography? Yeah, lot's of tunes by Foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that reek more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, somebody got PAID to write this drivel? Secondly, the REAL story of Foster is a fascinating one. Why not even come CLOSE to it? Thirdly, what did they have on the great Ray Middleton to get him to do this film? Pictures of him with small boys?? With communists? What a waste of a great talent.<br /><br />So, friends of Foster, and the truth, and good entertainment, be afraid... be very, very, afraid.","The reviewer found the film to be a complete rip-off, labeling it as drivel and expressing disappointment in its portrayal of the real story of Stephen Foster. The musical biography was criticized for its subpar quality and for not doing justice to the subject matter. The reviewer also questioned the motives of the actors involved, particularly Ray Middleton, in participating in the film."
Can you give me some examples of shows you prefer over Twin Peaks?,"We are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor. We may confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, confess, that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear, that much of it was created out of pure intuition without real concept.<br /><br />Well, obviously many people like such stuff. I don't. I prefer well thought and planed shows. And I also confess, that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring...those love and drug stories...There are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense (Dallas e.g.), but Twin Peaks can't catch my attention. I don't care about those people, except Cooper and Gordon Cole.","The show is described as incomprehensible, lacking a real concept, and too serious for the reviewer's taste. They find the love and drug storylines boring and express a preference for well-thought-out and planned shows like Dallas with more suspense."
What were the main flaws of this movie?,"This is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of Hollywood dreck.<br /><br />Kurt Russell, as Snake Pliskin in a business suit, convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard self, and does little to be a convincing victim.<br /><br />Every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when Kurt clouts Ray with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. Kurt and Madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace, and EVERYBODY--- except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again.<br /><br />He does, of course, and Russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm, which was ENTIRELY unnecessary. This movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene--- EXCEPT Hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or ""enhance"", the more slobbery they get.","The movie was criticized for its lack of originality, predictable plot, unconvincing performances by the actors, and an unnecessary emphasis on violence. The characters were seen as one-dimensional and the overall execution was deemed as Hollywood cliche-ridden dreck."
What audience might appreciate this film?,"I saw this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as did presumably all the other voters. The Director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project, which I think explains the above average reception and mark it got. It's most similar to a feature length episode of Aussie kids favourite ""Round the Twist"" but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature. The movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all UN member states, as I can't think of another Fijian movie but overall it was generic, poorly acted (albeit by an amateur cast) and prey to the subaltern mentality. The moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over, but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in, all problems can be solved (by leaving the island).","The film may be of interest to those who enjoy exploring movies from different countries and cultures. It may also appeal to fans of amateur cinema or those who are specifically interested in Fijian cinema. However, overall, the film falls flat with generic storytelling, poor acting, and a problematic portrayal of native islanders."
What might have disappointed fans of warrior movies in this particular film?,"I am a huge fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The last samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is absolutely awesome, and which i strongly recommend, i had high expectations from a Sergei Bodrov movie. But it was terrible, awful, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen, but it didn't, then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end, but even that was a huge disappointment, just some random running around, waving with the swords... There are so many good warrior movies, this one is not one of them.","Some fans of warrior movies may have found this film to be terrible, with the lack of exciting events and a disappointing final battle."
Can you elaborate on the main issues with the movie script?,"this movie let me down decidedly hard. it was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script. The story just didn't flow and was disjointed at best. There were so many elements to this story that were not explained, or were forced into place with out any real thought. elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more, and the cannons need to be written in better. the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around. everyone likes a good ""little guy overcomes"" story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be. While it did have some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence it was lackluster due to a lack of choreography. this made for a maddeningly boring watch<br /><br />it could have been so good :(","The movie let me down decidedly hard. The great concept was ruined by a horrible script that made the story disjointed and lacking explanation for many elements. The love story was not developed enough, and the cannons felt forced. The main character's growth lacked depth, with too much standing around and not enough focus on his training. The final battle sequence, although with some pyrotechnics, was lackluster due to poor choreography, resulting in a frustratingly boring watch."
What were some of the major flaws or disappointments in the film?,"Disappointing film. Performance of actors is weak. Sets are fine, could have been better. The story is also weak. Battle sequences are awful. Sounds and quality of film are trashy. The history of Kazakh people was told very poorly. This film should have included more Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And also should have been in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic origins. I don't get it. Since when Hispanic people play Turkic-Mongolian people. This film is shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the finest filmmakers in the world. Czekh director is excused, since he is not nomadic origin, he cannot know true spirit and history of nomads.","The performances of the actors were weak, the sets could have been better, the story lacked depth, battle sequences were poorly executed, and the overall quality of the film, including the sound, was subpar. The portrayal of Kazakh history was also poorly done, with the lack of Kazakh actors in leading roles and the use of actors of Hispanic origins inappropriately cast."
What aspects of the movie were specifically disappointing to you?,"This is simply put, the worst movie I have ever seen. It ranges from like 2+ hours, and the box art was totally misleading. My friends and I rented it because, we thought it would be a poor man's 300. You know, to laugh at and make fun of. No. There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then, the movie starts up, and they are speaking some sort of different language. We think, 'Oh its just the beginning.' But no, from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground. Omit Cinematography, and this movie belongs in trash compactor. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.","The movie I watched was absolutely terrible. It was excessively long, misleading in its marketing, and lacked any enjoyment factor. The language barrier and lackluster battle scenes made it feel like a tedious chore to watch. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
What did you find distracting about the hero in the movie? <br />,"Yeah, right.<br /><br />I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off. It was horribly boring, and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero comes into the picture. Born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Obviously white. He wasn't even close to passing for Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Pointless battle sequences and lame dialogue. It's an hour and forty five minutes long, and by the end I was trying to eat my own face. I watched this because people at the video store where I work are always asking me if this movie is any good. Now I have an answer. It goes something like this: ahem. ""NO! GOOD GOD NO! IT'S HORRIBLE! DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF! I would recommend another movie, perhaps one that's entertaining.""","The hero's portrayal was completely off, with an Asian character growing up to look unmistakably white, resembling Justin Timberlake more than anything. This inaccuracy was highly distracting and took away from the overall viewing experience."
"Would you recommend watching ""Dracula II:Ascension""?","""Dracula II:Ascension"" is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of Dracula.When a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students $30 million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction,it's an offer they can hardly refuse.Soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the Vatican!""Dracula II:Ascension"" is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws.The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is pretty average.There are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene,but there is not enough violence for my liking.The film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense.So if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look.I prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from 60's and early 70's like ""Lips of Blood"",""The Brides of Dracula"" or ""Lemora:A Child's Tale of Supernatural"" to name only a few.4 out of 10.","The film ""Dracula II:Ascension"" is described as a somewhat entertaining horror movie with noticeable flaws. The characters are flat and the acting is mediocre. Despite some impressive gore effects, the level of violence may not be sufficient for some viewers. The lack of suspense and quick descent into boredom make it a forgettable experience. If you enjoy contemporary vampire films, you might find some enjoyment in this, but it may not be a top choice for those who prefer more atmospheric vampire movies from past decades. With a rating of 4 out of 10, it falls short in delivering a gripping and memorable story."
Can Ascension be considered an improvement over its predecessor?,"Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee Is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.') Jason London is funny as Luke, the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal Dracula's body from the slab. Diane Neal Is good as the woman who steals Dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend, And Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler did the count in the original film. Roy Scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie, and he does a decent job as the mentor of Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second sequel in the trilogy, and they are off to a good start. It's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note.","Ascension is better than the original movie in terms of story and special effects, with talented actors like Jason Scott Lee and Diane Neal shining in their roles. The portrayal of Dracula by Stephen Billington surpasses the original performance by Gerard Butler. The addition of Roy Scheider to the cast adds depth to the film. This sequel proves to be a promising second installment in the trilogy, leaving audiences hopeful for a satisfying conclusion in the final film."
"What may disappoint fans of the previous film ""Dracula 2000"" in this sequel?","I cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh, and well written, if poorly acted.<br /><br />This pile can't even claim that. It starts with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that. Following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow, but Craven chose to go in the style of his older films, having no good tie but the main villain's name.<br /><br />Even the actor playing Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here).<br /><br />Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies.","The sequel fails to follow the narrative properly and lacks the innovative and fresh elements that made ""Dracula 2000"" enjoyable. The new actor playing Dracula and the disjointed storyline make this film a disappointment for those with a good taste in movies."
What makes this vampire movie stand out from other classics like Nosferatu and Dracula?,"This must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story? Apparantly not such a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks all these things.. Too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about?<br /><br />Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was defintely original, but this one's just not good, not in any way. Hopefully the third one will cary the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.","This movie turned vampires into a lackluster and uninspiring story without the dark and gloomy atmosphere essential to such films. The excessive lighting detracted from the essence of vampirism, leaving Dracula weak and poorly portrayed. The only redeeming quality was a brief dancing scene towards the end, but it fell short of saving the film from being a disappointment."
What could be improved about the movie's plot and overall direction?,"***Possible Spoilers***<br /><br />When I saw this today I had some expectation of how it would be like, not too high, but not low either. This was nothing like I expected at all though, it seems to me like the movie makers couldn't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make.<br /><br />In the begining of the film it's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting, but that'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes... As I watched further I almost fell asleep a couple of times.<br /><br />The ending is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter/comedy...<br /><br />I'm not saying it doesn't have some good scenes it's just that the film never becomes ""whole"".<br /><br />4/10 Movie-Man","The movie fails to maintain a coherent storyline and shifts awkwardly between different genres, leaving the audience feeling confused and disappointed. The promising beginning quickly gives way to ridiculous and obvious scenes, leading to a lackluster viewing experience. The disjointed nature of the film results in moments where viewers may even find themselves struggling to stay awake. Additionally, the ending itself is deemed by many as over-the-top and absurd, almost bordering on the realm of splatter comedy. Overall, despite a few redeeming qualities, the film ultimately falls short of delivering a cohesive and satisfying cinematic experience."
What were some of the major flaws in the movie?,"This movie had mediocrity, laziness, and thoughtlessness written all over it. If you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already, then you better do a damn good job. I'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. Some scary/horror movies just fail to break the mold of the ""lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies"" cliché. This one, sadly, was no different, and like all scary movies, once you venture down that road there is no going back.<br /><br />And the ending? How do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie, but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end? The ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 which I will never watch. Terrible movie.","This movie had a lackluster plot that failed to bring anything new to the vampire genre, resulting in a predictable and unoriginal storyline. The characters were poorly developed, the ending was unsatisfying, and it left much to be desired in terms of excitement and innovation."
What are some of the main weaknesses of the movie?,"Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate reclusive one-time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle checks out for good. Might've been entitled ""Bancroft Talks"" as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic/dramatic/sentimental material for its duration. Hot-or-cold director Sidney Lumet can't get a consistent rhythm going, and Bancroft's constant overacting isn't scaled back at all by the filmmaker--he keeps her right upfront: cute, teary-eyed and ranting. Estelle becomes a drag on this scenario (not that the thinly-conceived plot has much going on besides). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone is trampled by her hamming. *1/2 from ****","The movie suffered from Anne Bancroft's constant overacting which overshadowed the performances of the rest of the cast. The plot was thinly-conceived and failed to offer much depth, leaving the supporting actors, such as Ron Silver, Carrie Fisher, and Catherine Hicks, with very little to do. Director Sidney Lumet struggled to maintain a consistent rhythm, while Bancroft's exaggerated performance as Estelle made her character more of a burden than a sympathetic figure."
Was the movie based on actual events? I sincerely hope not! What made the shooting scenes highly unbelievable and why did the documentary style not work for the reviewer?,"This movie was based on actual fact? I sincerely hope not!<br /><br />We get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torso's. That's a great idea; aim for the armor!...excuse me, but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud. Or were there invisible tanks protecting them? were they from Crypton?Did i miss something here?<br /><br />This movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot-out it really takes a turn to boringlane.<br /><br />And that documentary style didn't work for me either, but thats just something one finds likable or not.<br /><br />Highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through 'til the end.<br /><br />3/10 for the fine editing.","The movie started out decent enough, but after 20 minutes of shoot-out, it took a turn to boringlane. The reviewer found it highly unbelievable, pointing out the unrealistic portrayal of armed cops aiming for armored torsos rather than the obvious targets of the heads or legs. The documentary style also did not resonate with the reviewer, making it hard to sit through the entire film. With a rating of 3/10, the only praise went to the editing."
Did the movie deliver the action-packed and thrilling experience expected of a police movie?,"Men, do I love police movies filled with action, shooting, chases etcetera.<br /><br />Boy, was I let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. We've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding... Yet, 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some Kevlar.<br /><br />Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Going back into the bank, where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out. How stupid did the director think we'd be.<br /><br />Okay, the shots in between that fake a documentary were good, but after seeing the film I only got the thought: why didn't the police get a decent shooting course? And why where there so many cops and was SWAT on a real long break. Truly bad.","This movie fell short of expectations with its repetitive and unrealistic plot. The excessive gunfire and lack of strategic police response made the film feel lacking in credibility. The director's attempt to create suspense through a documentary-style shot was noted, but overall, the movie was disappointing."
What are some criticisms of the movie in terms of its portrayal of the LAPD and the action sequences?,"Yeah, Madsen's character - whilst talking to the woman from the TV station - is right: the LAPD IS a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie changes nothing about it. Okay, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even a black one, whow, a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not like that. And most important for the action fans: The shoot out is boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then you will at least have something to do. The only moral of this film is: The LAPD is good now. No more bad cops in it. If you like uncritical, euphemistic commercials for police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 Points for camera and editing).","The reviewer points out that the film presents an idealized version of the LAPD and fails to accurately address its issues of corruption, violence, and racism. The action scenes are criticized for being monotonous and lacking excitement, with the shootout scenes being particularly dull. The reviewer feels that the movie serves as a glorified advertisement for the police force and military, rather than critically engaging with the real problems within these institutions."
How accurately does the movie 44 minutes portray the historical events of the North Hollywood shootout?,"As we all know Hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies. For example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who were shot near the end of the movie, this is far from the truth! But of course Hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they *add* some more blood and guts. Some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what Hollywood has always done so why complain? I guess the only sad part is that I have watched some one hour documentaries about the North Hollywood shootout on TLC that were far better then this!","The movie takes several liberties with the true events, adding extra drama and gore that didn't happen in reality. It blends characters and situations, straying too far from the actual timeline of the incident. Viewers who have seen documentaries on the subject may find the exaggerated Hollywoodized version disappointing."
What were your thoughts on the casting and historical accuracy of the movie?,"This was a better than average movie I thought, for it being on cable. I had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as Christmas Rush or First Daughter/Target/Shot, etc.<br /><br />The cast was well chosen...I especially liked Ron Livingston as the hard pressed SWAT Commander. It's good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in Band of Brothers. The producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997.<br /><br />So, if you get a chance to see this film, and I am sure you will since FX reruns everything 50 times...take 2 hours and enjoy it.","I think the movie was better than expected, especially for a cable movie. The cast was well chosen, Ron Livingston stood out as the SWAT Commander. The attention to detail in recreating the 1997 setting was commendable. Overall, it's a good movie to watch if you have a couple of hours to spare."
What made this movie so disappointing for viewers?,"This movie is awful. At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back. The ""twist"" ending is very contrived. The character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation-- with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve-- is explained away in literally ninety seconds of ""No we were just tricking you."" Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it! ""I will forgive you if you can forgive me,"" is as upset as he gets. If someone took weeks to convince me I was about to die and then said ""No, sorry , just fooling you"" I would raise some serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from watching. Please save yourself and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE.","The movie is awful, wasting viewers' time with a contrived and unsatisfying ""twist"" ending that contradicts the characters' development. The buildup to a major event is dismissed in a mere 90 seconds, leaving audiences feeling cheated and uninvested in the characters' emotional responses. The lack of authenticity in character reactions and the feeling of being deceived make this film a regrettable watch."
What were some drawbacks of the movie JUDAAI according to the review?,"JUDAAI was a bold film by Raj Kanwar at it's time In 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the box<br /><br />To give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants<br /><br />The film however is damn melodramatic, many places ridiculous<br /><br />One wonders why Anil doesn't buy a TV for his wife? when he earns so much Just to show how poor he is?<br /><br />The twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's The Johny- Paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the story<br /><br />Even there are several cringeworthy scenes<br /><br />Direction by Raj Kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic Music is okay but most songs look forced<br /><br />Anil does his part well Sridevi is excellent in her part Urmila is decent Amongst rest Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh irritates Farida is decent","The movie JUDAAI was critiqued for being overly melodramatic and at times ridiculous. The abundance of cringeworthy scenes and an outdated handling of twists reminiscent of the 80s were also highlighted. Additionally, the forced nature of most songs and the inclusion of a comedy subplot that didn't mesh well with the story were noted as drawbacks. The performances of the cast were a mix of excellence, humor, and irritation."
What genre does the movie fall into and what makes it entertaining for certain viewers?,"It's not the most well made slasher movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty amusing. The plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. I have to be honest, if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film, you wont find this film as funny as those who do. I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour, in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. It's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills,most of which are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch, drink and be merry!","The movie is a slasher film featuring several bands, and despite its poor quality in terms of plot and production, it still manages to entertain with its gore-filled kills. Fans of the featured bands may find it funnier than others, but overall it's a cheesy yet enjoyable movie to watch with friends."
Was the movie's quality worth the cost spent on it?,I couldn't believe I spent $14.00 on this. The only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore. The dubbing was worse than any I have ever experienced. It looks like it was shot with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on the special effects because there was a whole lot of blood and body parts everywhere. Its one of the worst movies I have ever seen but I do have to acknowledge the plentiful gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable,"The movie was a disappointing waste of money. The only positive aspect was the excessive gore, but even that couldn't make up for the poor dubbing and low-quality production. It felt like watching a movie recorded on an old VHS camcorder. Overall, it was one of the worst films I've ever seen, with the excessive gore being the only mildly redeeming factor due to the absurd and unbelievable nature of the movie."
Was it difficult to take the movie seriously due to the lack of realism and low production quality?,"Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money (I may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it MIGHT have been slightly humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by.. Oh I don't know... 78 minutes. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />DVD Extras: Bonus movie: ""Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence""; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released films","The movie's excessive blood and gore would have been enjoyable if it looked remotely real, but unfortunately, the production quality appeared to be done on a tight budget. The horrendous dubbing and lack of realism made it hard to engage with the film, and even with a short runtime of 78 minutes, it felt overly long and tedious. Overall, it's best to avoid wasting time on this one."
"What did you think of the wardrobe, gore, and acting in the movie?<br /><br />","I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S@#t I have ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror, but I got bored and turned it off.Let's see:<br /><br />The wardrobe: Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. <br /><br />The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I must give it that. But Ittenbach's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie. <br /><br />Acting: Was horrible! I didn't mind the dubbing. I find this humorous like in Ittenbach's ""Premutos"" (great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't watch any of Schnaas's movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. Check Premutos, House of blood, Schramm and the nekromantiks.",
"Can you provide a negative review of the film ""Deadly Night of the Dead""?","I cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is! I want my $3.99 back! Words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap! The dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor's mouths. The movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder. I have shot better movies with my cell phone camera. The gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot. The acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a Saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped, then tried to put on a play in your garage. Don't get me wrong...I wasn't expecting O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable. Avoid!","The movie ""Deadly Night of the Dead"" deserves a hard pass from any viewer. The poor dubbing makes it difficult to follow the already nonsensical plot. The outdated filming quality resembles a home video rather than a professional production. The gore scenes are comically bad, taking away any semblance of horror. The amateurish acting feels like a drunken garage play with friends. If you're a fan of zombie flicks, steer clear of this disaster of a movie."
What elements of the film were particularly disappointing to you?,"I am dumbfounded that I actually sat and watched this. I love independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. But when you add ninga's, you've crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope the people in this movie had a great time making it, then at least it wasn't a total waste. You'd never know by watching it though. Script? Are you kidding. Acting? I think even the trees were faking. Cinematography? Well, there must've been a camera there. Period. I don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie. Such a total waste of time that I won't prolong it by commenting further.","The film lacked a compelling script, decent acting, and any semblance of proper planning, making it a total waste of time."
What are some of the shortcomings of this Christian propaganda film?,"This movie is another Christian propaganda film in the line of The Omega Code. Not that that is necessarily bad but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to deliver. If you enjoy a styrofoam portrayal of life on the streets and the way the Gospel can change a life, than perhaps you may enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will Christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear (huh? criminals say bad words?) and flat characters I really could not relate to. Also, it would've been great if the movie had shown some T&A. Now that would be something I'd like to pay to see. Who was the blockhead who compared this communion wafer-thin story of a movie with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?","The movie sacrifices realism and sincerity for its message, offering a styrofoam portrayal of life on the streets and failing to create relatable characters. It also lacks the gritty authenticity that some audiences might expect from a film involving criminals."
Can you tell me about the overall atmosphere of the movie?,"I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, then it's VERY close. Ever seen a bad teen soap opera. Well this is like one of those. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLY SPOILER) girl: I wanna go somewhere else.<br /><br />guy: all we need is here.<br /><br />girl: but I wanna take myself somewhere different.<br /><br />guy: I'll take YOU somewhere else.<br /><br />... Proceeding this line they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've EVER read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the personalities of the characters and the events. Additionally, they just get rid of things. Also, the movie ends about before the book finishes. It is an AWFUL movie. So, if you haven't read the book, don't watch it. If you HAVE read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like stupid teen soap operas that are lower quality than your average low quality teen soap opera, go for it. Then again, should we expect anything different from MTV?","The overall atmosphere of the movie is terrible. It feels like a cheap, poorly made teenage soap opera with cringeworthy dialogue, bad music, and characters that are completely different from the book. The movie fails to capture the essence of the story and ends abruptly before the book's conclusion. It's a complete disappointment and should be avoided by anyone who values good storytelling."
Can you tell me more about the movie in your opinion?,"awful, just awful! my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this. they changed so much it is hardly recognisable. which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. it's like one of those Lifetime movies that say ""based on a true story"" but are completely fictional. there is none of the emotion or depth of the book, just mindless melodrama. if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, i suggest you try another version.","It sounds like this movie was a massive disappointment for someone who was a fan of the book. They felt that the adaptation did not do justice to the source material, lacking the emotional depth and substance of the original story. It seems like the changes made in the movie left the viewer feeling like it was unrecognizable compared to the book. The reviewer also compared it to mindless melodrama and suggested high school students to avoid this version if they are trying to get out of reading."
What does the reviewer think Dane could improve on in his comedy performance?,"Dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. To much. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I didn't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars. Just because there both up on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really into that when he was alive. He had a few good jokes like the Burger King joke where people yell at the drive thru. I also liked the Reese's Pieces joke. If Dane just didn't act so mental he might be funnier and I might have given this a higher rating, as high as maybe an eight.","Dane's exaggerated antics and excessive energy were off-putting, with the reviewer suggesting he calm down to enhance his comedy. The comparison made between comedians and rock stars seemed unclear to the reviewer, who found it lacking relevance. Positive notes included a couple of jokes that resonated with the audience, but overall, Dane's over-the-top behavior hindered the potential for higher ratings."
What did you find annoying about the characters in the film?,"The best that I can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times, and that it was an adequate time killer. Unfortunately, this film is also so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters around. This is the kind of film that is so sweet, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is SO nauseating. When the two leads aren't together on-screen, this really isn't bad at all, but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another.","The best that I can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times, and that it was an adequate time killer.

What aspects of the movie failed to resonate with the audience?,"This is meant to be a comedy but mainly bad taste, and nothing remotely causing a smile in the film. The movie is about a couple trying for a child, and those people in real life who are in that situation will wince at the depictions that are portrayed. For instance scenes at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and are quite frankly embarrassing. The male lead who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is. Both leads come across as unappealing,unattractive and completely unconvincing. There are various ridiculous and totally unassuming gratuitous scenes in the film, for example with a budget airline, which is devoid of any humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for Shirley Maclaine, who is a a class above anything else in the pic, and one mark for some half decent(albeit old) music.","The comedy in the film is mainly in bad taste, with scenes that fail to bring a smile and may cause discomfort for those going through similar real-life situations like depicted in the movie. The portrayals at the fertility clinic and the characterizations of the leads, especially the male lead as a construction worker, come off as unconvincing and unappealing. The attempts at humor fell flat, including scenes involving a budget airline, and the only saving graces were Shirley Maclaine's performance and some decent music."
"Was the pacing of the movie appropriate, and did the ending make sense?","<br /><br />I'm not sure who decides what category a movie fits into, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was fairly interesting, but rather slow. I was especially disappointed with the ending though.<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />Tell me why on Earth does she run over to her uncle's(?) home without at least calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what's going on at that point, plus she has a video tape as proof. Instead, she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying ""I know everything, I have proof! You didn't expect proof, did you?!"" Then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he's going to harm her. Well DUH! Of course he's going to harm you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything. What a dumb ending.","This movie was a letdown. The pacing was slow, and the ending was nonsensical. The main character's decision at the end was utterly foolish, making the conclusion feel unrealistic and frustrating. It missed the mark on building up suspense and resolving the plot in a satisfying way."
What are some of the flaws in the movie El segundo nombre according to the reviewer?,"After the overrated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish Horror Movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is all in films like El segundo nombre, a TV-like production bad written, but acted and directed even worse. I didn't read the Ramsey Campbell book, but I'm sure that the author of The Doll Who Ate Its Mother didn't have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at any cost, unless you're searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater. 2/10","The movie is described as a TV-like production with poor writing, acting, and directing. The reviewer also mentions that it fails to do justice to the source material, criticizing it as a terrible production with a rating of only 2/10."
What genre does the movie fall into?,"""True"" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. Not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The film is watchable but isn't at all scary (blame how some of the attack scenes for that). Its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. Odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told, ""here watch this"", which is what happened to me. If you're handed a copy give it back, the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable.","The movie's storyline about three girls being chased by a maniac in the woods may interest viewers seeking a thriller, but despite working with a low budget, the film falls short in delivering genuine scares and fails to leave a lasting impact. The attacks scenes lack intensity, and overall, the movie ends up being forgettable. It's the kind of film that might pass the time if you have nothing else to watch, but it's not worth actively seeking out."
"Based on the reviewer's negative feedback, how would you describe the pacing and acting in the film?","After a fairly lengthy partially pixelated nude shower scene, we're off to the races for this ""Blair Witch Project""-esquire horror film about three girlfriends venturing to a desolate cabin deep in the woods to get away from their hectic lives for a girls' weekend out and smoke pot. They meet two guys who seem friendly enough, so they drink and tell ghost stories, until late in the movie some of them get picked off.<br /><br />This is a fairly slow movie, with needlessly drawn out 'suspense' scenes, the bad acting can't carry the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but mindless banter, and the movie as a whole is a dud, a deathly-boring dud at that. Nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it did I was to numb to really care.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Ashley Totin shows T&A; Evy Lutzky gets topless briefly; and Jennifer Hart shows her right tit <br /><br />My Grade: D","The pacing of the movie was sluggish, filled with unnecessary drawn-out suspense scenes and mindless banter, making it a dull and unexciting watch. The acting fell short, unable to elevate the poorly written scenes and leaving the audience uninvested in the characters' fates."
Can you describe the overall mood of the film?,"HORRENDOUS! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by day care students...wait, I have seen programs better than this. Opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there. Good nude scenes, but that is it. Sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could hear the roaring of the camera motors. YIKES! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people. This batch of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons. Voted 1 out of 10.",
What aspects of the filming in the movie were critiqued as being poorly done by the reviewer?,"I'm not saying that because the production values were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. That shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek? Did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot? It was terrible, the lighting was just plain bad. You could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course not I skipped through most of it, and I don't want to hear anyone say I need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. This film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible. Awful movie...don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors ""funny"" lines, it's because of how painstakingly bad the production is.","The reviewer criticized the film for its terrible filming quality, mentioning issues with lighting, sound clarity, and overly long shots that added no value to the viewing experience. The reviewer found the production to be so bad that they couldn't bear to watch the entire movie, deeming it a waste of time."
"What are some of the strengths of the film ""French Connection""?","Most of the French films I've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but that's okay. I found them interesting, well-photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, I did at one point wonder if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film ever made! It seemed that way.)<br /><br />This movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening. But then it became talk, talk and more talk....which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery. After awhile, I almost fell asleep watching this.<br /><br />Actually, the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room. Thus, if you love plays, you should like this...but I want a little more bang for a murder story.","The movie ""French Connection"" is a visual feast with intriguing actors, giving it an interesting and captivating appeal. However, it falls short in delivering the necessary action and suspense expected in a murder mystery, instead focusing heavily on dialogue which may lead to a loss of audience engagement."
What were some of the unrealistic plot points in the movie?,"This movie was probably about as silly as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case in point:<br /><br />1. In order to fake her drowning Roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her ""death"" the YWCA calls her husband at work to give their condolences. HELLO how did they get his work number?<br /><br />2. Before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet. Days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the John. Does this mean the toilet was never flushed?<br /><br />3. No explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home (since she did it behind her RICH husbands back).<br /><br />4. Towards the end of this tiresome film Roberts suspects her husband is in the house. Instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly.","The movie was filled with highly improbable scenarios and unanswered questions, making it difficult to suspend disbelief and fully enjoy the film. From absurd swimming lessons to unexplained financial situations, the plot left a lot to be desired. Additionally, the protagonist's questionable decisions during moments of danger only added to the overall sense of frustration for the audience."
What movie features Julia Roberts in a thriller about spousal abuse but fails to deliver a compelling performance or intriguing plot about the subject matter?,"Julia Roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool Pretty Woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller, but it's hard to imagine she'd end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing (and oscar winning) as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this rubbish. And make no bones about it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately, her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it.<br /><br />The plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable, and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care. <br /><br />Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying, without Roberts' name above the title, I'm sure it would have totally flopped, deservedly.","Julia Roberts fails to impress in this lackluster spousal abuse thriller that lacks depth in its characters and fails to provide any real insight into the issue. The plot feels more like a late-night made-for-cable movie and ultimately leaves viewers disappointed and unsatisfied. Roberts' performance, although an attempt to break away from her typical roles, falls short of expectations, making the movie heavily reliant on her star power rather than its own merit."
"What elements contribute to the lack of originality and uninspired feel of ""Sleeping With the Enemy""?","""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a predictable, 'been there before' thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try. I can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.<br /><br />The complete lack of originality from the Ronald Bass screenplay (based upon the Nancy Price novel) does not help, nor does the stale direction of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance from Julia Roberts. The supporting cast including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do little to help.<br /><br />There really isn't a lot to say. Just give it a miss.<br /><br />Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne","The movie ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a predictable and uninspired thriller with a screenplay that lacks originality, direction that feels stale, and performances that come across as average at best. The cast, including Julia Roberts, fails to elevate the film, making it an unremarkable and forgettable watch."
What is the central premise of the movie Serum?,"Serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. The mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. There isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.","While Serum presents an interesting premise involving a serum that goes awry and creates monsters, the film falls short in terms of directing, continuity, and the lack of zombie action. The acting is average, and the effects are nothing exceptional. The slow-paced scenes can be fast-forwarded through, with only the action sequences offering some enjoyment. Additionally, the movie contains nudity and crude language."
Did the movie succeed in portraying authentic Latin American culture?,"I don't'know... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian but all that stuff was too much. Too much love for the music, too much parties, too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything looks too fake to me: the families, the relationships, the music, the ""happiness"". It simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture. I must be honest: it did seduce me a little, but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music, sex and parties? I'm not that stupid: what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea, profound sadness and STDs? I liked the scene with Caridad's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.","The movie was criticized for exaggerating the love for music and parties, as well as showcasing unrealistic and fake relationships and lifestyles. The portrayal of the city and the characters was seen as superficial and not representative of true Latin American culture. The reviewer found the film to be seductive, but ultimately lacking depth and authenticity."
"What did you think of the character portrayals in ""Triumph of Love""?","""Triumph of Love"" is proof that not every Comédie-Française author who uses cross-dressing disguised courtship like Shakespeare is worth seeing. <br /><br />Or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a Commedia Dell Arte-inspired playwright of whom Brittannica says: ""His nuanced feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage."" <br /><br />While Mira Sorvino has fun dangling three mixed-up romances, her pants role wasn't even up to Cherubino in ""Marriage of Figaro.""<br /><br />The herky-jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech.<br /><br />Best was Fiona Shaw as the fooled spinster, as well as the costumes.<br /><br />The glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to wink that this is all artifice doesn't really help.<br /><br />(originally written 5/29/2002)","Despite Mira Sorvino's efforts, her performance fell short compared to other actors in similar roles. The editing of the film was choppy, indicating multiple takes were needed for long speeches. The attempt to break the fourth wall with the glimpses of the audience and closing curtain call did not add to the overall viewing experience."
What makes this movie so unbearable to watch for the reviewer?<br />,"I borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful. How wrong am I!<br /><br />It is such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is SO bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She is a pretty girl, but in this movie, She is not seductive at all, but I will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters. It is so ridiculous.<br /><br />And the dialog of the film is so pretentious, and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable.<br /><br />Totally failure.","The reviewer found Mira Sorvino's performance to be extremely poor, lacking seductiveness and authenticity, making it painful to watch her attempt to seduce other characters. Additionally, the dialogues in the movie were considered pretentious and lacked humor, leading to the overall failure of the film."
Did the movie 'The Triumph of Love' live up to expectations?,"""The Triumph of Love"" doesn't triumph over anything. It is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. Actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. It pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not quite as awful. Maybe they were trying to be so over the top, so as to be clownish, but, if so, I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino doesn't make an impression one way or the other. She(he)'s just there. My guess is, the play of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is much better. It couldn't be any worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I don't know what she was thinking when she created this bomb. <br /><br />Maybe it all got lost in the translation.","Sadly, 'The Triumph of Love' fell short of expectations. It was a tedious and drawn-out experience, clocking in at nearly 2 hours but feeling much longer. The performances from talented actors like Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw were unimpressive, with supporting actors failing to elevate the film. Mira Sorvino's presence in the movie was forgettable. The movie, inspired by a play from centuries ago, failed to capture any intrigue and left much to be desired. The director's vision seemed to have missed the mark entirely."
Can you elaborate on what made the movie so awful?,"Gods, I haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it is that astoundingly awful. Mira Sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by Freddie. The movie staging was awkward (like a play, rather, and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it. And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn the dvd player off, it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film.","The movie was absolutely dreadful from start to finish. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, especially Mira Sorvino's performance which was cringeworthy at best. The staging felt awkward and seemed more suited for a stage play rather than a film. The entire cast appeared lost and clueless, making it painful to watch. Sorvino's accent was terrible, and her attempts at being seductive were laughable. The random shots of a live audience in lawn chairs only added to the nonsensical nature of the film. It was so bad that I couldn't even bring myself to finish watching it, opting to turn off the DVD player instead."
What offensive themes and topics were present in the movie that made it go too far in its attempt at comedy?,"I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I love wacky foreign comedies--particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise. However, although this one frequently caught me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in that nearly EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from pot, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of pedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years-old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! Funny?! You've got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into the ""black hole of comedy"". What should they make fun of next, cancer or rectal tumors?","This movie tried to incorporate shock value by constantly delving into taboo topics like pedophilia, drug abuse, and prostitution, which ultimately led to making the humor more cringeworthy than funny."
What are some of the flaws in the movie Tatie Danielle?,"Tatie Danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite. There's a bit of subtext that might be about France's colonial past but it's mostly just Danielle doing the sorts of things (like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers. Sadly, that doesn't happen here. It looks good and the acting is fine and there's nothing really wrong with the concept but it's just so SMUG. God, does this movie love itself. Pity it isn't nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is. The only impetus in the show - sorry, movie - comes from Danielle getting nastier and nastier, and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this. That's right: just like in a sitcom, which is what this is, with the added 'bonus' of delusions of grandeur and a 110-minute running time.","Tatie Danielle may look visually appealing and have decent acting, but it ultimately falls short due to its smugness and lack of genuine cleverness or humor. The plot relies too heavily on the main character becoming increasingly nasty without much depth or surprise, making it feel more like a sitcom with delusions of grandeur and a dragged-out runtime."
What elements did the reviewer find particularly disappointing about the show?,"What a piece of stupid tripe.<br /><br />I won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. It's not worth the time. The one comment I will make is - why get such a DUMB, inarticulate doofus to be the star?!?<br /><br />There aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that FOX has stated it will NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series) but WILL bring back brain-dead drivel like Joe Millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public.<br /><br />FOX has lost it, IMHO.","The reviewer was highly critical of the show, describing it as stupid tripe and a waste of time. They expressed dissatisfaction with the choice of the main actor, calling them a dumb and inarticulate doofus. Additionally, the reviewer expressed disappointment in the decline of television networks, specifically mentioning FOX's decision to not renew a decent series but bring back brain-dead drivel like Joe Millionaire, which they believe contributes to the deterioration of the American public's mental condition."
Can you think of any positive aspect about the movie?,"Uh oh! Another gay film. This time it's showing the black side. Bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending! But WHY? With only less than a half dozen exceptions, ALL gay films have to end in death or an ""addio"" finale. It's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's. The lead...male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion. Why in God's name must writers, directors, and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed? After all, it's supposed to be gay...not glum. Maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film. A large percentage of gay relationships DO last and the couples DO ride off together into the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, for here comes another 'gay' film! This is WRONG!",
What is the plot of the movie and how does Lionel Atwill's performance stand out?,"Another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by Poverty Row in the 1930's, resurrected by the magic of DVD.<br /><br />Starring stock Universal player Lionel Atwill (often a supporting actor in numerous Frankenstein movies) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket. One kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks witnesses for the exact time, while the other is deaf and is proved ""innocent"" because he could not have spoken to witnesses.<br /><br />Of course, where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness, wouldn't they both be deaf? Oh, well.<br /><br />Atwill does a pretty good job here, faking being deaf and mute. Unfortunately, no one else here can really act worth a darn.","The movie is a forgotten gem from the 1930s, brought back to life on DVD. It stars Lionel Atwill as a pair of twins involved in a murder scheme, with one pretending to be deaf and mute. Atwill's performance is notable, but the rest of the cast falls short in terms of acting ability."
What aspect of the plot is critiqued in the review?,"This one is a real bomb. We are supposed to believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can't go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking, quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper happens to show up. Some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things, a la ""Misfits,"" but no such luck with this one. Gary later breaks in to a formal dinner, at which Merle is presiding, and, though invited to sit down and join the group, reads them a lecture on their snobbery. Where did this diffident cowboy's sudden eloquence come from? The most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that Gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.","The movie is described as a bomb with an unconvincing storyline involving a sheltered woman, politicians, and a sudden eloquence from a cowboy character. The scenes are criticized for lacking excitement and coherence, with particular emphasis on a cringe-worthy party scene that seemed never-ending."
What did the reviewer feel was lacking in the documentary 'Darkon'?,"""Everything a great documentary could be""?? Yeah, if one is deaf, dumb, and blind. Everything but meaning, wit, visual style, and interesting subject matter. Aside from that. . .<br /><br />Seriously, volken. This is a movie that is completely inauthentic. An adventure doc with no adventure, a war doc with no feeling for war, a campy send-up with no trace of wit. It means nothing, feels like nothing, and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. No wonder it has so many IMDb fans! Of course, going in you know a movie starring the great Skip Lipman will have no culture, no intelligence, no wit (other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness), and no recognizable human emotion  just adrenaline. ""Darkon"" isn't a movie -- it's a panic attack! Avoid. There too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build-up such as ""Darkon"".","The reviewer found 'Darkon' to be completely inauthentic with no meaningful content, wit, visual style, or interesting subject matter. They criticized it for lacking in adventure, emotion, culture, intelligence, and wit, as well as expressing a belief that the movie implies nothing matters. The reviewer described it as a panic attack and advised to avoid it in favor of real documentaries."
What themes are explored in the movie and how is dark humor used in the storyline?,"A less-than-subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked, especially ""If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?""<br /><br />Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some might disagree) of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the ""company line"" and condemns half the world to burn in Hell. To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas pageant.<br /><br />However, when the quartet ""update"" their play to parody Sister Mary's ""fallacious"" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events. The ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts.<br /><br />Not recommended. Go watch the play instead.","The movie is an offensive portrayal of the Catholic Church through exaggerated characters and overly dramatic scenarios. The attempt at dark humor falls flat and the overall storyline is distasteful. It ends on a completely unsatisfying note, leaving viewers feeling disturbed rather than entertained. Avoid watching this movie."
What are some disappointing aspects of the movie?,"Strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by genre-mainstay Andrew V. McLaglen, so is that any wonder?). Army colonel Brian Keith spars with smarmy bandit Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped the colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found her niche after playing Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger""). Fist-fights, shoot-outs, stagecoach robberies and Denver Pyle in a supporting role...in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Talking in a low monotone throughout, Keith gets to dally with a prostitute (something of a shock after his run on TV's ""Family Affair""), but otherwise this low-rent material wastes Keith's amiable talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who doesn't seem to notice or care. Hack direction, poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor. * from ****","The movie is described as a routine western with nothing new or original, featuring hack direction, poor writing, and unfunny attempts at humor. The performances of the talented cast, including Brian Keith and Dean Martin, are deemed as wasted on low-rent material."
What was your overall impression of the way the movie portrayed the historical and cultural aspects related to the locations it was set in?,"All I can say is, before watching the movie I did not have a hint indication who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what was her life story..and I have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data.. and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by typing few words on google website; however, all I can say is that the actress Jeanette Hain was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status, as it is in real.<br /><br />After all , based on the script the movie has happened in turkey and Tehran as well as Afghanistan.. but believe me I am familiar with the area , it was all about an Arabic desert in morocco.. Turkish people and persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not arabic..<br /><br />I suppose for making a film like this- documentary type- a thorough research about all these minor elements is mandatory..","A major downside of the movie was the lack of attention to detail regarding the historical and cultural accuracy of the locations portrayed. The setting being misrepresented, with scenes supposedly in Turkey, Tehran, and Afghanistan, actually filmed in a Moroccan desert, showcased a lack of authenticity. Moreover, the failure to distinguish between Turkish, Persian, and Arab cultures, languages, and people was a notable flaw that significantly impacted the film's credibility."
What historical inaccuracies were present in the film?,"Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in Iran speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. That is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the actual.<br /><br />Other factual errors: A train is shown to be operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez (the red hat), whereas the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.","The movie was poorly researched and contained several factual errors that significantly undermined its credibility. The portrayal of locals in Iran speaking Arabic instead of Persian and other inaccurate details like the presence of a train in Afghanistan where railways don't exist, the Turkish ambassador wearing a Fez banned before the movie's timeframe, and the ambassador's daughter dressed as an Indian with Indian classical music playing in the background, all contributed to a lack of authenticity in the film."
What made you feel disconnected from the characters and disappointed in the lack of dialogue and plot development?,"We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled. It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It is not that i don't like cult-movies I do. But nothing happens in the film. One does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialog. And the car. How do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car? It is a two seater! I have to say however the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie, so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway.<br /><br /> I would not recommend it, as it is a waste of your time","The movie was an absolute disappointment, lacking any meaningful connection to the characters and dragging on with scenes that felt like a waste of time. The plot was weak, and the unrealistic logistics of the characters carrying a huge tent and other camping gear in a small car were distracting. Despite the beautiful scenery, the movie would have been better suited for a photoshoot, saving viewers from the endless monotony of watching nothing substantial unfold on screen. I would not recommend this movie at all, as it only serves as a time-waster."
"What is the main strength of ""Tapeheads"" according to the review?","""Tapeheads"", a scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of the music video business, might have been the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're the real thing in buddy-comedies. *1/2 from ****","Despite the comedic talents of John Cusack and Tim Robbins, ""Tapeheads"" falls short due to a forced and unnecessary side-plot involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which only serves to detract from the movie's primary focus on spoofing the music culture of the late 80s."
What was your overall impression of the movie?,"Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I totally regretted it! These two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad on its own)sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-I can't think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack haven't disappointed me ever since. I would recommend you to avoid this film, unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled.","I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The supposed comedic sketches were unoriginal, cringeworthy, and downright embarrassing to watch. It felt like Tim Robbins and John Cusack were phoning in their performances, and the whole movie came across as a cheap attempt to capitalize on their names. I would strongly advise avoiding this film if you have any respect for these talented actors."
What makes this game so challenging and frustrating for players?,"One of my sisters friends lent me this game, and it is too damn hard! It carries the appearance of a kids game, but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions, and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your 'score'! You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UP TO STAGE THREE!!!!! Maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this, but otherwise keep away! AND IT IS DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS - THEY WILL PULL THEIR HAIR OUT WITHIN THE HOUR!",
What aspect of the movie's content did the reviewer find lacking and why?,"My complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand. While using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this or that ailment, &tc., or the ad nauseam footage of his small German hometown). Also, the movie crawls along in covering c. 1920-1939 and then steams through the war years. In sum, the film is little better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average History Channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of Goebbels' life. Still, I found it wanting.","The pacing of the movie was criticized for being slow, especially during the years leading up to World War II, and the selected material was deemed uninteresting, making the film feel like a mundane History Channel documentary despite some slight artful arrangement."
What elements in the movie failed to impress the reviewer?,"The John Goodman program was pretty awful, but this thing just plain stinks. The one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everybody is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable, unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it. The worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow!","The reviewer found ""The John Goodman program"" to be quite terrible, but their disappointment escalated when it came to this movie. The only thing that brought a slight smile to their face was recognizing Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The storyline was deemed hopeless, created by someone with fuzzy memories of childhood rebellion but lacking adult insight. The characters were all portrayed as unpleasant for no apparent reason, leading to a dark and paranoid world. The plot was perceived as predictable, with the movie jumping from one random and unconnected scene to another in a dull and frustrating manner. Critically, the reviewer noted a lack of familiarity with snow among the production crew, adding to the overall disappointment."
"What makes ""Severed Ties"" a film not worth watching?","A young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father's work on limb regeneration.His overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil purposes.A young doctor uses reptilian DNA he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later,he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm...Admittedly the special effects in ""Severed Ties"" are pretty good and grotesque,but the rest of the film is awful.The severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people.Big deal.The acting is mediocre and the climax is silly.3 out of 10.","The movie ""Severed Ties"" falls short in terms of its storyline and acting, with mediocre performances and a silly climax. The only saving grace is the decent special effects showcasing the grotesque limb regeneration. The concept of a murderous arm behaving like a snake feels unimpressive, leading to an overall rating of 3 out of 10."
"What are some common themes found in SEVERED TIES?,","The TV guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as thus : "" An experiment on a severed arm goes awry "" so right away I thought this was going to be about an arm that`s got a mind of its own as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone getting an arm transplant as in BODY PARTS . Both premises are tried and tested , or to be more accurate tired and tested so I was curious as to how the producers would approach the story . I actually thought they were making an arthouse movie like PI down to the use of B&W photography at the start of the film but the makers seemed to have tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splatter comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD . I`ve very little to say on this except that I disliked THE EVIL DEAD movies and I disliked SEVERED TIES and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world is crying out for condoms","SEVERED TIES had a plot that disappointed as it started off with the potential for a creative story involving a severed arm, but quickly devolved into a splatter comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD. The shift in tone was jarring and left the viewer feeling dissatisfied with the direction of the film. Additionally, the excessive use of rubber in the production of the movie felt wasteful and inappropriate given more pressing global needs."
What was the overall impression of the actors in the movie?,"Oh man, I know what your thinking: ""With a title like that, I can't go wrong!"" Uh yes you can. I too, loved the title, but man I hated the stupid kid that played ""Satan's little helper"" I hated the mom too, and the sister/daughter, and her boyfriend - I hated all those people! Man, it was agony watching this sometimes! The ONLY reason this doesn't get 1/10 is becuz condsidering the low budget, they did OK. But oh man did I hate those actors, so stupid! I knew it was going to be bad, I guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer, and the Jesus costume at the end was really stupid too. Oh the agony, do not watch!","The reviewer absolutely despised the actors in the film, especially the kid who played ""Satan's little helper"", the mom, the sister/daughter, and her boyfriend. They found watching the movie to be agonizing due to the poor performances. The only saving grace was the low budget, which they felt allowed them to scrape by with an okay rating. Overall, the reviewer advises against watching this film."
"What is the overall tone of the movie ""Satan's Little Helper""?","with a title like this, you know not to expect a great horror movie. But this was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the entire movie ! the actors are not that bad, but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid. No suspense, no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically at that. It became so boring towards the end, that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I couldn't care whatever happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction, but come on.. that was 13 years ago, and she hasn't done anything decent after that. So no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap.. Avoid or be warned..","The movie ""Satan's Little Helper"" falls flat in delivering a cohesive and engaging horror-comedy experience. The plot is unoriginal and absurd, the characters lack depth, and the attempt to blend horror and comedy fails miserably. Despite some decent acting, the overall film is boring, lacks suspense and gore, and becomes so dull that some viewers may lose interest before it even concludes. Amanda Plummer's involvement in the movie, while she shine in the past, does not salvage the poor quality of the film. It's best to steer clear of this one."
Would you recommend watching this movie?,"Plot: an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra-marital hijinks in a flashy car. They then become stuck (literally) in a Compromising Position, while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities.<br /><br />That's it. That's the entire movie. There may have been some dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless, but actually physically painful to watch. The fact that it starred two of the UKs best up-and-coming actors (one of whom is now sadly deceased) only adds to the horror.<br /><br />Ian Charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved Oscar-winning 'Chariots of Fire'. Let's remember him for that role, and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloidal abomination never happened.","The plot is incredibly shallow, lacking any meaningful dialogue, making it painfully pointless to watch. The performances of the talented actors could not salvage this celluloidal abomination."
What is the general plot of the movie described in the review snippet?,"<br /><br />Ok, well I rented this movie while I was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers, and let me say, It didn't help the film any.<br /><br />The film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I don't want to spoil (not that there was anything to spoil) I shall let your imagination figure out the ""Zany"" (and I use that word lightly) antics that follow.<br /><br />I had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film, and I would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't, it's a waste of the film it was printed on.<br /><br />Then again I could be wrong...","The movie was described as a snooze-fest and a waste of film, with the reviewer struggling to stay awake while watching it. The storyline about a man buying a car during a midlife crisis didn't capture the reviewer's interest and was labeled uneventful and unexciting. The reviewer advised against watching this movie if you're looking for something adventurous or entertaining."
What makes this film difficult to follow and unenjoyable for the reviewer?,"OK the plot is, wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes, strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies (Sometimes a combination of the two) Then a demon comes around kills the men, rapes and kills the women, and waxes poetic about the meaning of life. Moronic special effects, bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside, you get what you expect from a film with a title like this. I guess it would have to be someone's cup of tea, just not mine as I have yet to see a good Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu directed film.<br /><br />DVD Extras: Subtitled Interview with Director Kazuo Komizu Part 1 (Part 2 is on the Entrails of a Beautiful Woman DVD); and Theatrical Tailer<br /><br />My Grade: F","The lack of a clear plot, excessive sex scenes, poorly executed special effects, bad acting, and the bizarre philosophical elements make it hard to follow and ultimately unenjoyable for the reviewer."
What elements make this Kazuo Komizu gore flick worth watching at least once?,"Less self-conscious and much less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, this Kazuo Komizu gore flick is worth a look (at least once).<br /><br />Sleazy snapshotters escort wanna-be actresses/models to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually molest them. Unfortunately (for the horny boys), a long-schlonged demon, who lives in the woods, has already targeted the girls for fun.<br /><br />The thing even ends up having fun with the boys -- that's IF you consider beheadings, dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs ""fun"".<br /><br />Once again, it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film.<br /><br />Just as Komizu mangled LIVING DEAD AT TOKYO BAY with his ineptitude, he also mangles this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great white panty shots.<br /><br />Don't buy the hype, though, or you'll be sorely disappointed.","This Kazuo Komizu gore flick is less self-conscious and pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, offering a sleazy yet engaging story about snapshotters, wanna-be actresses/models, and a long-schlonged demon in the woods. The film features audacious violence and some great white panty shots that add to its appeal."
"Do you think ""The Reluctant Astronaut"" is worth watching?","After leaving TV's popular ""The Andy Griffith Show"", Don Knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matinée-pleasing comedy vehicles. Unfortunately, ""The Reluctant Astronaut"", filmed on the cheap (as were most of Knotts' movies), is much worse than his others. Don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to Astronaut Training camp...but not as a candidate for space travel--they want him as their new janitor! Some may say the weak satire capitalizes on Americans' then-fresh fever for the new age of technology, but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied. It gets off to a good start, with an OK set-up and nostalgic locations, but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic. * from ****","""The Reluctant Astronaut"", despite Don Knotts' attempt to transition to movie stardom, falls short of being enjoyable. The film, which capitalizes on Americans' fascination with technology, offers a weak satire and lacks substance. While it starts with a promising setup and nostalgic locations, it quickly loses its charm and descends into idiocy, failing to captivate the audience and leaving much to be desired."
What are some aspects of the movie that may not appeal to all viewers?,"This has been put out on the DVD market by Alpha, and it's for die-hard Boris Karloff fans (like moi) only. It's not a horror flick, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work. But once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />It's appeasing enough seeing Karloff as another selfish sinister type, and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious (especially from the leading lady Mona Goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double-crossed wife).<br /><br />But proceed with much caution.","This movie may only truly satisfy devoted Boris Karloff fans, as it strays from the horror genre and features unintentionally funny acting, particularly from the leading lady."
What were viewers expecting from the two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms in this movie?,Ariauna Albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery. What could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner Lilith Stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician. This was a production that cried out for some T & A & with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things. However Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances & to a extent salvages her reputation. The Tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play & T & A. Nough said.,"Despite Ariauna Albright's commendable acting skills, this movie falls short due to its lackluster script and missed opportunities for more engaging content. While Albright's performance is noteworthy, her co-star Lilith Stabs fails to deliver, appearing more focused on her appearance than her acting. The film's potential for entertainment is overshadowed by the absence of compelling storytelling and missed chances for more risque elements that viewers anticipated."
What are some standout performances in the movie?,I find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged. The only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humour is also to be appreciated. She is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage. However she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism. Can't say the same for her co star Lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system. Appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed. All said apart from Ariauna's performance it is indeed utter trash.,"The movie disappointed in every possible way. It seems like a failed attempt to improve upon the original material. Despite a commendable effort from Ariauna, the overall film falls flat. Lilith's performance is lackluster, contributing to the general feeling of disinterest and inadequacy. The one redeeming quality seems to be Ariauna's character, but even that isn't enough to salvage this cinematic disaster."
What could have improved the movie featuring Ms. Albright and Ms. Stabs?,It is difficult to find any positives in this movie. Seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of Galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots of the two cops & a lot less of Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun. Ms Albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate. Ms Stabs whom I had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent. Apart from Ms Albright this is real garbage.,"The movie was deemed a flop due to the overemphasis on a poorly received film within the plotline. The only saving grace seemed to be the attractive police girls' visual appeal, overshadowing the lack of substance in the film. Ms. Albright's performance was the sole highlight, while Ms. Stabs fell short in terms of acting skills, contributing to the overall disappointment of the movie."
What are the main criticisms of this movie?,"Using footage pillaged from Planet of Dinosaurs this shot on video (except for the stolen footage) concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that is...don't wait for it, is really earth. Its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes. Slightly better than Chickboxer (another in the Bad Movie Police series)-having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects, this movie is still an impossible slog to get through. I'm left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that we're now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage? Clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money","This movie is essentially a mish-mash of stolen footage and a weak storyline stretched out to an unbearable 90 minutes. The lack of creativity and desperation of low-budget producers to generate any sort of entertainment value is evident throughout the film, making it a tedious and unenjoyable watch."
What are some aspects of the movie that make it unappealing to a wider audience?,"First of all let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie. The best review for this kind of Cinema can be just the silence. Movie addressed to housewives and to grandmothers. This movie tries to look ""genuine"" and the characters should be supposed ""real people"". An Italian could never think that the characters might be ""real"": they are just ""low-profile"" stereotypes. It gives a very misguised vision of what life is in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (plot? which plot?) and the humour does not make laugh anyone older than 12.","The movie is targeted towards a specific demographic such as housewives and grandmothers, with characters portrayed in a stereotypical and inauthentic manner. The plot is lacking substance and the humor falls flat for anyone older than 12, presenting a misinterpreted view of life in the Italian countryside."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find to be lacking or disappointing?,"Horrible. I see many user comments on how great this show is. It truly is a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are lame as...and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines (if you can call them that). The bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet (or at least another continent). There are obviously reasons that TV companies cancel shows...and none of then are when shows are doing well. Make sense? Anyway, steer clear - even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do...go stand in the rain instead - more fun.","The movie was a complete disaster, a poor attempt at humor and storytelling. The jokes fell flat, the plot made no sense, and the actors seemed to be trying too hard to be funny. It seemed like a cheap imitation of another popular show, with none of the charm or wit. It's no wonder why the reviewer advises others to avoid this movie at all costs."
Can you describe the overall tone and genre of the film?,"The Class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates.<br /><br />I like the idea of the show. That's why it saddens me that The Class is not funny, even though it has the obvious potential. It's not enough corky, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines. Also some actors have difficulties with timing.<br /><br />Most inventively written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh) but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show. On the other hand the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the used-to-be- couple Duncan and Nicole.<br /><br />What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino character Aaron is being picked on for his accent (even though by a non-respectable character, but anyway).","The Class is a comedy series that falls short in delivering humor despite having potential. The slow pace and lack of truly funny punch lines make it more dorky than quirky. Some actors struggle with timing, and certain characters like the twins Kat and Lina Warbler stand out as the most well-written but still feel too rigid for the show. The main character Ethan and the couple Duncan and Nicole come across as uninteresting. Additionally, the depiction of the Latino character Aaron being mocked for his accent is concerning."
What makes this movie so difficult to watch all the way through?,"I must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful. An incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man? This movie was rife with absurdities of which if I mentioned them all I would be giving away the movie. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie. The acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. As a sane minded and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie. There was ineptness on the part of every main character, there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. One absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie, it only makes a talkative train wreck.","The movie was filled with absurdities, deplorable acting, and a nonsensical story. It was a talkative train wreck with inept characters and ridiculous events strung together aimlessly."
What movie disappointed the viewer due to its predictability and below-average acting?,"I read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie. Jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. The acting was below average most of the time, especially by Mckenna. I haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone ""badass"" in a movie. Oh man, this movie was a letdown. I also read somewhere this might be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just a average piece of film.<br /><br />The script was lame, for the most part the acting was lame, this movie was lame.<br /><br />Oh and pray for the guy that used to be in Cheers. He looks really bad. <br /><br />The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in Office Space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes.<br /><br />4/10",The Return.
"Can you guess which horror film involves a family moving to a new house and being stalked by demonic forces, with lots of teen angst scenes and a dream sequence filled with blood, featuring many Aussie actors from ""Neighbours"" and ""Home and Away""?",A question for you : A family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . Which film am I talking about ? Every horror film you`ve seen ? Yes that`s true but that`s not the answer I`m looking for . I`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . Doesn`t help ? Well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s POV . No futher forward ? Okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? Could still be any horror film you say . Oh gawd this could take weeks so I`ll say the film I`m talking about features loads of Aussies many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY . Yes that`s right the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE ( aka CUBBYHOUSE ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? It`s about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made,"THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) is just like any other generic horror film, offering nothing new or original in terms of scares or plot."
What about the movie disappointed the viewers who have knowledge in physics and cognitive science?,"Anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will walk out disgusted after 40 min., as my wife and I did. The ignorant masses might be entertained by the hand-waiving arguments and the absurd ""conclusions"" drawn (without even an attempt at a logical reason) from real science. I'm offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of ""science"". I can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book, didn't understand a word of it, then watched The Matrix about a thousand times, and proceeded to write this movie.<br /><br />For example, the Washington DC crime experiment was done by The Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief search will reveal the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm)<br /><br />Save your money.","The movie's presentation of science was so nonsensical and illogical that it left knowledgeable viewers feeling disgusted after just 40 minutes. The film seemed to draw absurd conclusions without any logical reasoning, leading to the conclusion that the writers had a poor understanding of quantum physics and heavily relied on The Matrix for inspiration."
What kind of audience might enjoy this film?,"Remember the chain-smoking channeler exposed on 60 Minutes a few years ago? This is her. Lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers. The producers have been using phony ""word of mouth"" promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age dreck and day-old baloney, this film is for you. If you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha isn't a wacko, so you'll give her a bunch of your money. If you can tiptoe through the Ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>","The movie has been criticized for promoting pseudoscience and relying on deceptive marketing tactics. It appeals to those who believe in channeling, reincarnation, and new age concepts, but falls short for viewers seeking a more grounded discussion on quantum physics or reality. The filmmakers have been accused of using phony promotions to lure audiences into buying into the film's questionable content."
What were some of the specific aspects of the movie that the reviewer found unconvincing or ridiculous?,"I created my own reality by walking out of the theater I was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom. We (my g-friend and I) walked out about an hour into it. What a load of pseudo scientific new age jargon.<br /><br />Sub atomic particles are thoughts? By taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a Buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals? A drop of 25% in the murder rate in DC happened when a bunch of folks meditated. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time. Should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate? <br /><br />Hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /><br />BTW- It was funded by the Ramtha cult, the leader of which was one of the ""experts"" which were interview by the filmmakers. No ulterior motives here, right?","The reviewer found the concepts presented in the film to be pseudoscientific and full of new age jargon. They criticized the idea that subatomic particles equated to thoughts, the practice of taping labels to water bottles, and the correlation between meditation and a decrease in the murder rate in DC. The reviewer also raised concerns about the funding source of the film by the Ramtha cult, questioning the credibility of the experts involved."
What are some other resources for someone interested in quantum theory and string theory?,"If you're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory, read ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene of Columbia University, and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" by Stephen Hawking of Cambridge.<br /><br />Recipe for #$*!:<br /><br />3 parts bombastic New Age pontificator, 2 parts pseudoscientist, 2 parts real scientist<br /><br />Mix together until ingredients are indistinguishable from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible substance.<br /><br />Serving suggestion: barf bags.","The movie is a confusing mix of bombastic pseudo-science and real science that lacks any substance, leaving viewers reaching for barf bags to serve as a better use for their time."
What were some aspects of the movie that the reviewer found ridiculous and unbelievable?,"I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded interesting at times. However, the obvious nonsense of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some loony named ""Ramtha"" completely upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What a waste of two hours.",
"What are the key attributes of ""Waking Life"" that make it a must-watch movie for fans of intelligent and philosophical discussions?","If you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch ""Waking Life,"" which is brilliant. ""What the #$*! Do We Know"" is all over the place in its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying. It wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. The inclusion of that rambling freak ""Ramtha"" in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old Atlantian god or something? What a flake that old chick is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. The people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.",
What are some of the confusing and contradictory messages that the movie portrays about science and reality?,"If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $9 on a used textbook, not this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipment to Guyana. <br /><br />I don't think the directors really got any point across, but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, meaning that our lives are deterministic; 2) Science can't be used to explain everything we do, meaning that we have free will; 3) Science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough role to follow and 7) here, put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff.","The movie failed to clearly convey any coherent message about quantum mechanics, appearing to be a jumbled mix of conflicting ideas that left viewers perplexed and dissatisfied."
What cult is mentioned and what impact does it have on the movie?,"Another cult strikes again. This isn't a spoiler, because the REAL ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly-long, pseudo-scientific infomercial...Ramtha's School of Enlightenment.<br /><br />When any religion/philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ-like screen of deceit, I walk away. Thank Ramtha I watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a ""friend""...to have wasted precious resources on this New-Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they ""truly believe they can walk on water"" enough to take that guidance to it's ""logical"" conclusion...in other words; walk, drown...or shut up :-) As a movie...it deserves a strong ""1"" on it's entertainment value, especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history (the photographer's roommate...eeeeeek!). If you must see this film, borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it.","The negative reviewer found the movie to be an overly-long, pseudo-scientific infomercial linked to the Ramtha's School of Enlightenment cult. They were disappointed by the deceitful nature of the film and critiqued it for lacking entertainment value, specifically calling out the dislikable characters and recommending viewers to borrow the movie instead of wasting their resources on it."
What theme does the movie heavily rely on?<br />,"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas, capped by such statements like ""we all create our own reality"".<br /><br />Sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.<br /><br />The idea that ""anything's possible"" doesn't hold water on closer examination: if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible. This leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.<br /><br />To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.""","The movie heavily relies on twisting quantum mechanics to support nonsensical ideas and promotes the notion that everyone creates their own reality, which contradicts the fundamental concept of a shared reality and delves into postmodernistic nonsense."
What are some key aspects that make this show not believable and disappointing for viewers?,"I can't believe that the City of Muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. This show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law-enforcement officers. I have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie. I only saw it once and was appalled at what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy get into a foot-chase with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the Police Chief, and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city. No wonder it didn't stay around on TV","The show lacks authenticity and fails to accurately portray the real-life work of law enforcement officers, making it a source of embarrassment for the city of Muncie and its police department. It is criticized for being unrealistic and far from genuine, leaving the viewers feeling appalled and let down by the lack of credibility in its portrayal."
What are some major criticisms of the law enforcement aspects in the series?,"Not an altogether bad start for the program -- but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare -- and is anything but. Men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this. What is next, medical school in a minute? Charo performing lipo? Charles Grodin assisting on a hip replacement? C'mon...show a little respect. Even the citizens of Muncie are outing the program as staged. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor editing (how many times can they use the car-to-car shot of the Taco Bell in the background?), cheesy siren effects (the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call' whether rolling code or not), and last, but not least -- more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at.<br /><br />If I want to see manufactured police work and wise-ass fake cops, I would watch RENO 911.","The series is criticized for not respecting real law enforcement professionals, being staged, having poor editing, cheesy sound effects, and numerous officer safety issues. The use of a high school gym as a Police Academy and repetitive shots of the Taco Bell in the background further add to the negativity surrounding the show."
What are some major inaccuracies and negative portrayals of police procedures in the movie?,"What a poor image of Professional Police Officers is displayed on the Television in the watching of this alleged Reality show. One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a ""stop"" , then the ""Pat Down"" of the outside of one's Garment, then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someone's pocket and retrieved contraband, was cut out of the scenes, because if it wasn't, the arrest in most places are going to be tossed, should they even get passed a supervisor. A report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand. If the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout, it is good enough for an arrest, but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect. Since I haven't seen a Dis-claimer from CBS (I may have missed it), CBS could be in trouble.","The movie showcases a distorted and unrealistic image of professional police officers, with numerous inaccuracies in the portrayal of police procedures. The lack of attention to detail and the incorrect representation of legal processes contribute to a poor viewing experience."
Can you pinpoint any redeeming qualities of this movie?,"I'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union (and that's saying something!). Get out your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing resembling a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish. The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability I'm amazed it lasted past the first episode - correction, past the auditions. All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained. And it's obvious that the production costs must have been all of ₤100 per episode. And just in case anyone thinks I'm commenting as a foreigner who is unfamiliar with English humour, I must add that I am indeed English.","This movie is an absolute disaster. The script is not at all funny, the cast lacks acting and comedic ability, and watching it feels like a complete waste of time. It's a shame to see talented actors like Ronnie Corbett associated with such low-quality content. If you're looking for humor, you won't find it here."
"What aspect of the movie ""Expiration Date"" did the reviewer find disappointing?","Honestly, I was disappointed in ""Expiration Date."" Super clever title and interesting premise, but I don't think it delivered. What was it about? The main character's desire to reconnect with his Native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But, he wasn't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear -- it seems as if his life was going fine, but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying. I didn't buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film didn't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story. They were all just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a ""curse"" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I did love the shots of Seattle, cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding.","The reviewer found the storyline to be confusing and felt that the character's motivations were not well-established. They were critical of how the supporting characters were portrayed and questioned the significance of the 'curse' in the film. Although they appreciated the cinematography and some of the acting, they ultimately found the overall execution lacking."
What made this movie such a disappointment?,"I don't know what that other guy was thinking. The fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible. You can be as big a believer as you want... the majority of this film is mindless drivel. I feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it. And that alone was no small feat. Not only is the acting terrible, but the plot is never even close to developed. There are countless holes in the story, to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore. I've never read the book, so I can't critique on that, but this is the first review that I've written here and it's purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life. I can't remember the last time I couldn't even finish watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.","The fact that this movie was independently made did not save it from being terrible. The majority of the film is mindless drivel, the acting is terrible, and the plot is underdeveloped with countless holes in the story. Watching the first 40 minutes alone felt like a major insult, and it's hard to even call it a complete story. This review aims to save viewers from wasting an hour and a half of their lives, as the movie was so unbearable that the reviewer couldn't even finish it."
"Based on the positive reviews, critique the movie ""Celestine Prophecy"".","I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. Be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie. It is a ""B"" movie at best. Many events, characters, how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that in the book are very smooth, are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child. The character development is very poor. Personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a ""B"" horror flick. I understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book, but they screen play base missed many points. The casting was very good.","The movie ""Celestine Prophecy"" failed to capture the essence of the book it was based on. The adaptation was lacking in key plot points and character development. Events and interactions seemed forced and the overall flow was choppy. The direction of the movie resembled that of a low-budget horror film rather than a thoughtful adaptation. The film missed many important aspects from the book, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience for fans of the original story."
"What are some major shortcomings of the film adaptation of ""The Celestine Prophecy""?","Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel ""The Celestine Prophecy"", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of Armand Mastroianni. Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABC's ""Lost"" or Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", the filmmakers are hardly up to the task. This film reeks of ill-conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda, and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point.","The amateurish quality of the actors, heavy-handed direction, and the film's attempt at being intellectually stimulating fall flat, making it come across as ill-conceived spiritual propaganda with little substance for viewers."
Can you tell us about the character development and the plot of the movie?,"Boring. Minimal plot. No character development. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book. It COULD have been an awesome movie. It COULD have probably become a cult classic. Nope, it was a giant let-down. It was poorly cast and had horrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who were the bad guys: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I am still left puzzled by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so-called ""prophecy"", which is never really FULLY explained. I felt like I was watching a corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It seemed very much like a made-for-TV movie. Don't go see this movie. It is a waste of time AND money.","The movie was boring with minimal plot and lacked character development. It was a giant let-down compared to the book it was based on. The casting was poor, and the special effects were horrible. The confusion about who the bad guys were (rebels, military, church) added to the disappointment. Certain mini-plots and the ""prophecy"" were left unexplained, leaving the audience puzzled. The overall movie felt like a cheesy sci-fi mini-series on TV and is not worth the time or money to watch."
What were the aspects of this movie that led to its lack of appeal for you?,"This movie is just not worth your time. Its reliance upon New-Age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times.<br /><br />I was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when I noted that some have tried to prop-up the reputation of this drivel. Their motivation & objectivity is dubious, since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults, but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness.<br /><br />So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians, or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies/television that support their views? In spite of the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? I hope not.<br /><br />I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.","The movie's heavy reliance on New-Age mysticism and a recycled plot were major turn-offs, with the reviewer skeptical of those praising it solely based on its intended message rather than its flaws."
What did viewers find disappointing about the movie adaptation despite the beautiful cinematography?,"I read the book and the book was fascinating.<br /><br />This movie, it's direction, the screenplay, and the acting were totally insufferable. I cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity, and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story.<br /><br />I can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. Would not ever recommend this film to anyone I know. <br /><br />Simply, one of he worst adaptations I have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth.<br /><br />The cinematography was indeed the only highlight. But, how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as Peru. <br /><br />To prospective viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.","Viewers found the direction, screenplay, and acting totally insufferable in this movie adaptation. The lack of following the novel's action and courage led to a plotless exploration that failed to capture the essence of the original story. The film was not recommended for anyone and was considered one of the worst adaptations seen, with the only highlight being the cinematography due to the beautiful filming location in Peru."
What were some of the disappointing aspects of the movie adaptation based on the review?,"At first, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. It was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. The novel - in the first place! - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure! That's only the surroundings. In the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! Additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! They screwed it up! ... I'll never watch it again!","The movie was a letdown compared to the book, focusing too much on adventure rather than the important message, lacking in visual effects, and poorly explaining the events at the end."
What aspects of the movie contribute to making it a waste of time for the viewer?,"I have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time. The movie was boring, long long and awful plot. The special effects sucks like hell - It's like watching a movie back in 1999. It's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was quite bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he wasn't THAT bad. In fact not bad at all. But in this film, his acting wasn't convincing enough, it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either. Plus, his eyes seems empty like he's not feeling it. It surprised me, really, because he was good in Band of Brothers.<br /><br />Anyway, don't even bother to watch this movie. It's a big big BIG waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, get something else to do besides watching this movie. Trust me, you'll regret it!",
What did you think about the acting and screenplay of the movie?,"I actually went to see this film in a theater, but what a complete waste of time and money! Bad acting, I'm sorry to say, did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay.<br /><br />Some friends told me to go and see this film, since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very heavily involved in the screenplay. They had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect. Well maybe I had my hopes up a bit too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweetish to a point that I actually left I had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.","The acting in this film was subpar and the screenplay was sticky, making it a waste of time and money. Additionally, the predictability and overly sweet tone of the movie made it unbearable to watch."
What are some key flaws in the film's storytelling and overall impact on the viewer experience?,"If only to avoid making this type of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />","The film lacks a coherent storyline, making it feel like an aimless experiment rather than a compelling narrative. Despite touching on important issues, it fails to impart any meaningful insights or engage the audience, resulting in a tedious viewing experience that leaves viewers with no lasting impressions. Watching the film feels as unproductive as staring at a growing tree outside a window."
What are some shortcomings of the film?,"This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.","The film is criticized for lacking intellectuality, with one of the main actresses being perceived as annoying and acting stupid. The nudity in the film is also deemed unattractive, and it is compared unfavorably to a film by Godard. The reviewer found the film to be filled with silliness and gave it a low rating of 2/10."
What makes this film so unwatchable and trashy according to the review?,"I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?<br /><br />","The reviewer criticizes the film for being unwatchable and trashy, highlighting the ineffective sex sequences, amateur politics, self-conscious artistry, poor photography, out-of-focus scenes, wrong angles, bad sound, and overall lack of artistic merit."
What were some major issues with the portrayal of Lucille Ball in the movie?,"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.","The screenplay writer didn't seem to have done any research on Lucille Ball's life, making numerous factual errors throughout the film. The movie failed to accurately depict her early years and her relationship with Desi Arnaz, leaving out significant details and presenting a sloppy portrayal overall. If you're looking for an authentic biopic about Lucille Ball, this is not it."
What are some major criticisms of the movie?,"I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.","Despite competent performances and technical aspects, the lackluster script leaves the film feeling pointless and ultimately disappointing. Fans of the actors involved are advised to seek better options."
"What were some of the disappointing aspects of the movie ""Star 80"" according to a review?","Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful ""poodlesque"" hair-do....Very disappointing....""Paper Moon"" and ""The Last Picture Show"" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!","The casting choices, particularly of non-actresses like Patty Hansen, were a source of frustration for the reviewer. They expected a cinematic gem but were left underwhelmed with what they saw on screen. The reviewer likened the experience to watching Audrey Hepburn in a poorly styled outfit, finding the movie barely tolerable to sit through once. The movie's questionable quality was suggested as a reason for its lack of release, overshadowing any potential controversy around the subject matter."
What is the main flaw in the movie according to the review?,"Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.","The movie lacks a solid script, relying solely on the actors' chemistry and the setting to carry it through, resulting in a hollow and shallow viewing experience."
What makes The Zombie Chronicles a movie to steer clear of?,"Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies.<br /><br />Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks, TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put, avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease.<br /><br />My last 2 cents: Humorously enough, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)","The Zombie Chronicles is a disaster of a film that disappoints on every level. Filmed with what seems like spare change, the movie's attempt at horror falls flat due to a cast of untalented actors and unimpressive gore. The plot, revolving around a female reporter and a hitchhiker discussing zombie deaths, fails to engage or scare viewers, resulting in a forgettable and cringe-worthy viewing experience. The production quality is abysmal, making it difficult to comprehend how this film ever saw the light of day. To sum it up, avoid this film like the plague."
"What are some common pitfalls to avoid when creating a ""Twist Ending""-type movie according to this review of ""Zombie Chronicles""?","If the crew behind ""Zombie Chronicles"" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. In a ""Twist Ending""-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the ""reveal"" as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea.<br /><br />Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't...<br /><br />Only for zombie completists.","The movie ""Zombie Chronicles"" received criticism for spoiling its twists by showing close-ups of every death in the opening credits, lacking convincing acting performances, not having accurate props and costumes for the time period, and giving away the surprise reveal too early in the movie. Overall, the reviewer expressed disappointment in the film and suggested that it's only suitable for die-hard zombie fans."
Should viewers give this movie a pass?,"1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.","This movie falls flat in terms of originality and fails to offer a captivating storyline. The focus on 3D effects and flesh-eating zombies overshadows any potential for a compelling plot, resulting in a dull and predictable viewing experience. Audiences would be better off skipping this forgettable bore-fest and opting for the classic zombie films instead."
What are some issues that viewers may have with this movie based on the positive reviews?,"There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone?<br /><br />As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />This thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />","The lack of nudity, inconsistency in the time period setting with the vehicles shown, and poor execution of the stereoscopic 3D effects create a disappointing viewing experience."
What are some drawbacks of the movie?,"Without wishing to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams ""seriously, you could do better yourself"". Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.","The acting in this film is horrendous, the quality of the print is extremely poor, and overall, the movie lacks originality and reeks of clichés. It's a waste of time and money, and definitely not worth anyone's attention."
Would you recommend watching The Zombie Chronicles?,"My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br />Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself. Fact.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH","The Zombie Chronicles was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The movie was so unbearable that I would rather drink bleach or do my taxes than sit through it again. The acting was atrocious, the plot was nonexistent, and the production quality was laughable. Even the person who wrote it couldn't seem to do anything right. Stay far away from this film, unless you want to subject yourself to an excruciatingly terrible experience."
Would you recommend this movie to a friend?,OK its not the best film I've ever seen but at the same time I've been able to sit and watch it TWICE!!! story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way.<br /><br />And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling.<br /><br />overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it.,"The movie was described as awful and with a pretty pathetic storyline. The reviewer mentioned that they wondered what they were watching during the first part of the short story. Despite being able to watch it twice, the humor was labeled as cheap laughs, and the overall quality was not up to par. The only highlight mentioned was Jebidia's performance, although it was noted that even that was marred by the character's name calling stopping halfway through. Ultimately, the reviewer advised purchasing the movie only if seeking cheap laughs from a bargain bin."
"What were your thoughts on the overall quality of the movie?

Negative","I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.","This movie was just plain terrible. The main character's acting was so bad that even a child could outshine him. The plot was nonsensical, and the portrayal of the army guy was so exaggerated it was laughable. I only watched it to make fun of how awful it was. The movie should have been given out for free just to get rid of it. The only saving grace was the makeup, but even that couldn't make up for the atrocious performance and storyline."
Would you recommend this movie to someone who appreciates high-quality acting and attention to detail in filmmaking?,"..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like ""continuity editing"" and ""geographic match"". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.","This movie seems to lack continuity in its storytelling, with confusing shifts in time periods and poor acting. It appears to have garnered attention primarily for its 3D gimmick rather than its substance. People who enjoy well-crafted films by acclaimed directors might want to give this one a miss."
"What makes ""Camp Blood"" stand out despite being a low-budget horror film?","You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.","While Brad Sykes may be admired for his dedication to churning out budget horror movies, the audience is often left unimpressed. The lack of sufficient funds results in a film that struggles to go beyond basic levels, leaving viewers to make excuses for its shortcomings. Despite a spirited performance by Joe Haggerty, the film ultimately falls short in delivering a truly thrilling or well-executed viewing experience."
What aspects of this movie did the viewer find disappointing?,"Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.","The viewer expressed regret for spending money on a film they expected to be enjoyable due to the presence of zombies, but found it lacking. The only highlight mentioned was a gory scene, and the lack of nudity was criticized as well. The viewer found the movie so unpleasant that they humorously suggested preferring physical pain over a rewatch."
What made this movie stand out as one of the worst ever made for the viewer?,"I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.","The reviewer rented the movie about 3 years ago and it left a lasting negative impression, being deemed worse than a high school student's home video. The movie's attempt at a flashback to the 1970s was highly criticized, with inaccuracies such as modern clothing and possibly even a cell phone spotted in the scene. The viewer found the movie so unbearable that they returned it to the video store, expressing their dissatisfaction with the quality and questioning why the store carried it in the first place."
What did you find disappointing about the editing in the movie?,"I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.","The editing in this movie was quite lacking, with many scenes feeling out of place and disjointed. It made the story seem disorganized and lacking a central focus, despite the potential of the characters and overall plot. The editing definitely detracted from the overall viewing experience."
Were you satisfied with the adaptation of the book into the movie?,"I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.","I understand that movies can't include every detail from the book, but this adaptation of Love Come Softly fell short on capturing the essence of the original story. The film deviated so much from the book that it left me highly disappointed. The storyline felt forced and overly dramatic, lacking the heartwarming elements that made the book enjoyable. The overall tone of the movie was excessively gloomy, making it hard to connect with the characters and their struggles. This adaptation failed to do justice to the beloved book, leaving a lot to be desired."
"What are some common criticisms of the movie ""Love's Abiding Joy""?","As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that ""Love's Abiding Joy"" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
Did the movie have any redeeming qualities?,"This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get ""terrorized"" by this pathetic ""crazed killer"", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.","This movie was a total disaster. The acting was terrible, the plot made absolutely no sense, and the characters' decisions were just plain ridiculous. It felt like a complete waste of time watching these people stumble through a poorly constructed storyline. Save yourself the agony and skip this one."
Was it an absolute waste of time?,"Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.","The movie was a complete disappointment. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was subpar, especially from the teenage actors. It felt like a recycled storyline that offered nothing new. The film failed to deliver on the promised thrills, and left me wishing I had done anything else with my two hours."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find ridiculous and unconvincing?,"I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets ""visions"" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.","The reviewer found the concept of the mother getting ""visions"" when touching objects or people to be absurd and deemed Deedee Pfieffer's performance as irritating and awful. The plot was described as ridiculous and the acting as over the top, contributing to an overall negative viewing experience."
Was the TV series adaptation able to capture the essence of the original 1950s book and translate it effectively for viewers in the 1930s style?,The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.,"The adaptation fell short in blending the historical elements of the original 1950s book with the desired 1930s style. The decision to set the storyline around the Jarrow March felt contrived and the attempt to mimic 1930s aesthetics with a 1950s train felt inauthentic. The focus on Japp's personal woes seemed like a filler rather than adding substance to the plot, making it clear that the episode prioritized style over content."
What elements of the film did the reviewer find particularly frustrating or unnecessary?,"The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason...there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter...which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week...I'd have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.","The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason, with too many things thrown in that had nothing to do with the story, making it seem like the creative team didn't know what they were doing."
Do you think this movie is worth watching based on the reviews?,"This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.","This movie was a huge disappointment despite having great actors in the cast. It was slow and failed to engage the audience, making it difficult to connect with the characters. Not recommended, even for those seeking visual appeal."
What made this Australian story adaptation fall short?,"I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.<br /><br />The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.","The movie was described as clunky and uninvolving, lacking engagement from the start. Despite capable performances by Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom, the storytelling felt forced and predictable, resembling a poorly executed TV soap opera. The viewer was left disappointed, hoping for a more compelling experience."
What could have been improved in The Amati Girls?,"I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.","The Amati Girls is a total farce with clichés, awful hair, unrealistic scenes, and over-acting actors. It lacks real passion, is not funny enough to be a comedy, and feels too fake-sad to be touching. One of the oddest movies with no redeeming qualities."
Can you tell me about the plot of the movie you watched?,"Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... Robert Duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack","Holy crap.

"What did you think about the overall pacing and message of the movie ""Protocol""?","I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at Walmart I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!","While I enjoyed seeing Goldie Hawn in another movie, I found ""Protocol"" to be lacking in hitting its stride and containing scenes that dragged on without purpose. The preachy scene at the end left a bad taste, as I didn't feel it added any value to the film. Overall, I didn't find the movie to be quite worth the price paid for it."
What are some major flaws in the movie Protocol?,"There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and ""The Man who Fell to Earth."" I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the ""hillarious"" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.","The movie Protocol is a major disappointment, with an insulting script that lacks intelligence and relies on cheap gags like someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn's supposed charm falls flat, making her character come off as vapid and moronic. The film includes offensive stereotypes about Arabs and tries to win over the audience with shallow populist messages. The acting, including Goldie Hawn's performance, is subpar, leaving much to be desired. Overall, Protocol is a lazy attempt at filmmaking with a poorly written screenplay, making it one of the worst films to watch."
What is the main highlight of this movie?,"The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.","The storyline of the movie was weak and lacked depth. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was predictable. The only memorable scene was the one featuring Goldie Hawn in her bikini, which seemed unnecessary and objectifying. Overall, the film failed to deliver a compelling narrative."
What are some reasons to avoid watching this film?,"I was excited to view a Cataluña´s film in the Berlin´s competition. But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism . But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.","The viewer found the excessive blood, drawn-out storyline, and lack of cohesive themes in the movie to be disappointing. They criticized the portrayal of the Spanish Civil War, revenge, and other common topics as unoriginal. Overall, they felt the film attempted a pseudo-tragedy and deemed it one of the worst in film history."
Did the film's excessive cruelty and violence overshadow any potential positive aspects?,"this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid ""horror"" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.","The film was a major disappointment due to its level of relentless cruelty and violence. Some scenes were unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited, making it difficult to connect with the characters. The lead protagonist's slimy character added to the distasteful atmosphere. Furthermore, little was learned about the Spanish civil war, with the hothouse theatrics feeling over-the-top. The use of same-sex attraction as a lurid element was offensive and poorly executed. Overall, the film seemed like a messy attempt to shock viewers rather than deliver a meaningful story."
What makes this movie a struggle to watch?,"A very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. <br /><br />The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.","The movie is described as cheesy and dull, with failed attempts to come across as hip and modern through its editing and camera angles, which just end up making viewers sleepy. The cast is not utilized well, the writing is seen as stupid and pretentious. Overall, it is considered a waste of time and is labeled as pure garbage."
What are the major issues with the film?,"I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself ""The Devil"" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are Chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,","This film is incredibly problematic on many levels. The portrayal of native tribes as savages and the graphic violence towards women make it extremely uncomfortable to watch. The low budget shows in the poor quality of acting and special effects, and the overall storyline lacks depth and coherence. The excessive focus on violence and disturbing scenes takes away from any potential for meaningful storytelling."
"Does the movie ""Devil Hunter"" live up to the expectations of a horror film?","Not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director...""Devil Hunter"" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.<br /><br />The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like ""Cannibal Ferox"" and ""Cut and Run."" Chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic. I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film; this one just fell WAY short.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.","The plot of the movie seems disjointed and lacks the intensity and scares expected from a horror film. The setting of the 'jungle' appears unrealistic, resembling a park in Mexico rather than a menacing environment. The portrayal of the tribe and savages seems stereotypical and poorly executed, with a mishmash of ethnicities that come across as insensitive. Additionally, the lack of gore and excessive focus on unnecessary explicit content detracts from the overall viewing experience, making it a disappointing and unsatisfactory film for fans of the genre. Overall, ""Devil Hunter"" fails to deliver as a compelling horror movie, resulting in a rating of 2 out of 10."
What makes this film feel overly long and tedious?,"This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.","The movie's pacing is extremely slow due to excessive scenes of characters aimlessly walking through various locations, making the already short runtime of 75 minutes feel unbearable. Additionally, the lack of graphic violence and gore may disappoint fans of the zombie/cannibal genre who expect a more intense and gruesome viewing experience."
What aspects of the show left a lasting negative impression on you?,"This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon.<br /><br />There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it's miserably forgettable.<br /><br />The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it... Nananana ninja...","This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon.

What impact did the introduction of the female turtle in the TMNT series have on the familiar storyline and character dynamics?,"I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo , Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.","The addition of the female turtle, Venus, felt out of place and unnecessary in the TMNT series. Traditionally known for having four brothers named after famous artists, the inclusion of Venus disrupted the core dynamic and essence of the original concept. Fans of the 1987 TMNT series were left disappointed by the deviation from the well-established characters and their relationships, suggesting that the introduction of a female turtle did not enhance the action or storyline in a meaningful way."
What makes this film so bad according to the review?,"This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.","The film is criticized for terrible acting, with the reviewer calling it like an amateur hour performance. Even the presence of Michael Madsen is deemed disappointing. Additionally, the plot is described as terrible and lacking originality, with the overall quality being compared unfavorably to Hollywood action movies. The reviewer strongly advises against watching the movie, suggesting opting for a jog instead."
"What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find terrible, leading them to advise others to avoid it?",Terrible movie. Nuff Said.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage.<br /><br />OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.,"The reviewer found the movie to be a waste of time, with bad acting, moronic writing, and poorly contrived plot, making it a piece of garbage. They also criticized the inclusion of an unnecessary and disturbing rape scene, along with the frustrating requirement of writing ten lines for IMDb reviews."
What are some major issues with the movie that make it not worth watching?,"Assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.<br /><br />I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. And the rape scene...Christ! ""Shut up and take it"" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.<br /><br />3/10","The movie is filled with goofs and inconsistencies right from the beginning, indicating the lack of attention to detail. The plot fails to keep the audience engaged, leading to a lack of interest in the characters and their stories. The performances, including Michael Madsen's, come across as lackluster and disappointing. Additionally, the handling of sensitive subjects like the rape scene is highly inappropriate and off-putting. Overall, the movie falls short in every aspect and only serves as a reminder of wasted potential."
What aspects of the movie contributed to its negative review?,"I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out.<br /><br />Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.<br /><br />Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.<br /><br />I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.","The movie was filled with terrible script and dialogues, leading to even good actors failing to salvage it. The presence of amateur actors, especially non-native-English-speakers attempting to portray native-English-speakers, resulted in unbelievable and cringeworthy lines throughout. Additionally, the music was described as awful and out of place, making the whole movie feel like a low-quality school production."
"What were your thoughts on the movie overall?

Negative","This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. I've watched it at least 20 times....<br /><br />the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines.<br /><br />on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was.<br /><br />i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.","This movie was a complete disappointment. The acting was incredibly poor, making it painful to watch. The plot was nonsensical and seemed like it was put together haphazardly. Even though it falls into the category of being so bad it's almost entertaining, it's not worth wasting your time on. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one."
What makes this film lack appeal to a wider audience?,"This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and ""with it"" to be understood by us mortals.","The film's reliance on distorted images, lack of dialogue or plot, and repetitive nature make it a tedious and unengaging watch. It may only appeal to a niche audience who appreciate avant-garde or experimental art."
What makes this film so disappointing and not worth the watch?,"There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had...<br /><br />The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.<br /><br />From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand.<br /><br />Frankly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else...","The film disappoints with its unrealistic and rapid character development, leading to a predictable and unengaging storyline. The protagonist's sudden descent into spinelessness and irresponsibility feels implausible, making it hard for viewers to connect with the narrative. Aside from the presence of talented actresses like Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, the film lacks any redeeming qualities, ultimately resulting in a waste of time and money for the audience."
What are some drawbacks of the movie?,"Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it ""hot"". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />Note: Saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.","The movie suffers from a weak plot, predictable violence, and only somewhat intriguing characters. It seems like the writer, who is also one of the main actors, incorporated his own mistakes into the storyline and exaggerated with unrealistic drug and murder scenarios to create excitement. The film's soundtrack consisting of rap and house music, along with the depiction of family conflicts, comes off as poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately uninteresting. Additionally, the title of the movie has been used multiple times before, adding to the lack of originality."
"What aspects of the movie ""Reload"" disappointed viewers?","If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called ""Reload"" in production (as of June '08) in which he's playing a character named Sebastian Cole.<br /><br />First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second, didn't Sebastian get killed at the end of ""Loaded""?<br /><br />I watched this in the wee hours of the morning when I was battling insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed really weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.","The movie ""Reload"" was described as weak overall, with confusing plot points that were easy to miss. Despite Corey Large's decent performance, the film failed to leave a lasting impression on viewers. The plot was deemed uninspiring, lacking substance, and unmemorable. Additionally, some viewers were not impressed by the supposed beautiful girls in the film, finding them to be average rather than exceptional."
What are some major drawbacks of this film according to the review?,"This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.","The film is criticized for its poor acting, lack of believability in characters, and excessive use of flashy and annoying editing techniques. Additionally, the resolution is deemed unsatisfactory, leaving the viewer feeling disappointed and like their time was wasted."
What makes this film not worth watching?,"This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful.","This movie is a complete mess, lacking any originality and failing to deliver a coherent plot or engaging characters. The acting is subpar, with no memorable lines or performances. It shamelessly borrows from other thriller films without bringing anything fresh to the table, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience. It's no wonder that people might consider illegal downloads over paying to watch this kind of nonsense. Save your time and money, this movie is simply painful to sit through."
What are some of the major drawbacks of the movie according to the review?,"6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens ""storywise"", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics","The movie received poor ratings for acting, directing, and writing. The characters were over exaggerated, the story had numerous flaws, and the use of special effects, music, and pacing made it boring to watch. Overall, the movie was not worth the time and effort to sit through."
What impact did the director's style have on the overall quality of the movie?,"From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have given a decent performance.","The director's attempt to prioritize style over substance in this film ultimately falls flat, resulting in a disappointing and unengaging viewing experience. It feels like the plot was forced to fit the director's vision rather than letting the story naturally guide the filmmaking process. Despite some decent performances from the actors, the movie overall feels like a waste of time and effort, failing to deliver on its attempted stylish presentation."
What makes the overall tone and pacing of the movie difficult to engage with?,"I saw the capsule comment said ""great acting."" In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true ""bummer."" I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.","The actors in this film deliver abysmal performances lacking chemistry, making it hard to connect with their characters. The pacing is painfully slow, and the attempt to create an uplifting narrative about illiteracy falls flat, resulting in a disappointing and dreary viewing experience. Overall, this movie is one of the worst I have seen for its budget level, earning a mere 1 out of 10 rating."
"What makes the movie ""The Return"" a waste of time and talent?","Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.","Robert DeNiro's performance as an intelligent illiterate is seen as unbelievable and wasteful of talent, while the script and dialog are criticized as unrealistic. Jane Fonda's character is described as a caricature, and the overall pace of the movie is painfully slow. Additionally, the film is deemed preachy, filled with cliches, and lacking substance, with the supporting actors' performances unable to salvage its shortcomings."
What are some of the drawbacks or criticisms of the movie?,"Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.",The movie's absurdity and lack of a cohesive narrative make it off-putting and difficult to follow. The cryptic dialogue is challenging and may alienate viewers.
What did reviewers dislike about this movie?,"Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.","The uninspired direction led to a bland adaptation, with dialogue feeling forced rather than genuine. The appearances of the ghosts lacked magic and awe, and some actors like Edward Woodward and George C. Scott failed to deliver convincing performances. Overall, the lack of effort from the cast made the movie fall flat."
What did you find disappointing about George C. Scott's performance in the film?,"Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.","I found George C. Scott's performance in the film to be rather dull and lacking in emotional depth. Unlike Alistair Sim's portrayal in previous versions of the film, Scott's delivery of dialogue and emotional transformation fell short, making it difficult to be fully engaged in the movie. The lack of conviction in his performance made it hard to believe in the character's journey."
What were some of the main issues the reviewer had with the movie?,"Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: ""Merry Christmas to everyone!"" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny...","The reviewer found the rest of the cast's acting to be laughably bad, with repeated cheesy lines making it unbearable to watch at times. They also criticized the poorly written script, questioning how the movie received high ratings despite its flaws. Ultimately, they recommended watching the Bill Murray comedy ""Scrooged"" instead."
What are some issues with the movie?,"William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK.<br /><br />I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />Overall, it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it would receive a ""D"".","The movie is very predictable and cheesy, making the story delivery lackluster. The main character may have delivered an average performance, but the overall production falls short of being impressive. It's disappointing that even with the presence of a former star like Peter Falk, the movie still couldn't rise above mediocrity. The predictability of the plot especially in the last 20 minutes makes the viewing experience quite dull and unexciting. Overall, this movie would be categorized as sub-par, having nothing much to offer besides an underwhelming storyline and performances."
"Can you explain why you didn't like the movie ""Vivah""?","I never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, I gotta come really hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. After success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so so cheesy that Badjatyas have left Johars and Chopras behind.<br /><br />There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. Aloknath does cliché in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.","The movie ""Vivah"" was a total disappointment. The director, Sooraj Badjatya, seemed to have lost his touch completely. The film was extremely cheesy, with nothing good to offer. The performances were lackluster, the sets were unattractive, the costumes were poor, and the storyline was cliché. Even the background music was irritating. Overall, ""Vivah"" falls flat and is best avoided."
What were some disappointing aspects of the movie according to one reviewer?,"I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.","The reviewer found the movie to be old-fashioned with predictable and lackluster plot developments. They expressed disappointment in the lack of depth in the characters and the overall storyline, feeling like they wasted their time watching it."
What makes the romance in the movie unrealistic and difficult for real world viewers to relate to?,"A Cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot till the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely you're movie, but for the rest of us real world people, I'd highly recommend saving your three hour watch time. Wake up people!<br /><br />Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something.. I just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!!",
What could have been improved in the movie to make it more enjoyable?,"After being hugely entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance as a cad in ""The Tailor of Panama"" (which I rate 10/10 across the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional impact, etc.), I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that ""The Tailor of Panama"" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the ""good part;"" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7? Hardly.","The movie lacked depth and substance, failing to engage the audience both emotionally and intellectually. The excessive vulgarity felt forced and added no value to the storyline. Unlike ""The Tailor of Panama,"" this film fell short in terms of acting, script, and direction, leaving viewers feeling underwhelmed and ultimately dissatisfied. It failed to deliver any significant moments that would make it memorable or worth watching, resulting in a disappointing cinematic experience."
"Do the multiple unanswered questions and one-sided portrayal of the storyline make ""He Woman, Man Hater"" clubs the target audience for this movie?","The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the ""He Woman, Man Hater"" clubs of America. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be ""caught up"" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.","The movie fails to provide a balanced perspective on the romance and murder tale, leaving viewers with a sense of dissatisfaction and unanswered questions throughout. The routine storyline and lack of character depth make it difficult to fully engage with the plot, creating a disconnect that fails to captivate the audience. Additionally, the predictable narrative progression and lack of surprises make it a forgettable viewing experience."
What aspects of the film fail to create a genuine connection with the audience?,"This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they'd called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office.<br /><br />But the film falls between two stools and can't get up. The characters spout improbably bright dialog, but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. One arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell gets points for acting her little heart out, but the performing honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). Ms. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. Would that we could say the same about the writer-director.<br /><br />If Notting Hill annoyed you as being bogus, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.","The film tries too hard to replicate the success of other romantic comedies but ends up feeling artificial and inauthentic. The characters lack depth and realism, making it difficult for viewers to emotionally invest in their stories. The plot relies on contrived and illogical actions that fail to engage the audience in a meaningful way. Despite some commendable performances, the overall execution falls flat, leaving the viewer with a sense of disappointment and insincerity."
"What makes the movie ""Campy Love"" fall short for many viewers?","This had to be one of the worst films ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping...so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway this was such a campy movie. I usually like these type of films but I just couldn't get into this film. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's acting didn't help the film. Also, she is all gums. Lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals.","""Campy Love"" failed to impress many viewers due to its unrealistic scenes, lackluster acting, particularly from Andie, and an overall Hollywood-esque feel that turned off audiences. The film's reliance on clichés and poorly executed moments left much to be desired, making it one of the worst films for many."
What makes this film difficult to watch at times?,"This starts off bad, what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend' . ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.","The film portrays the characters in a way that feels unrealistic and cringeworthy, especially with the awkward dynamics between the three women and the questionable romantic storyline involving a former student. As the plot progresses, it becomes more absurd and unbelievable, making it hard to take seriously. The attempted symbolism towards the end comes off as forced and unconvincing."
"What was the most disappointing aspect of the movie ""Ladies on Duty""?","Caught this on IFC yesterday, and can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these ""ladies"" were anything but? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And she's SO devastated over his death, she doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the ""good news""! By the way, how did an American get to be the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better!<br /><br />As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, please! It's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! Where's the guilt over poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same to the bozos behind this ""movie""!","I caught this on IFC and I seriously can't understand the praise it's receiving. To be honest, the characters were far from likable or believable. Kate, who is supposed to be a respected figure, easily compromises her values for a man and then hastily falls in love with him. The lack of authenticity in their relationship just doesn't add up. Additionally, the plot inconsistencies are quite jarring, like an American suddenly becoming the headmistress of a British school without any clear explanation. The character Janine's abuse of power within the law enforcement should have had consequences, but everything is brushed aside, making the storyline seem unrealistic. Molly's character is also poorly developed, leaving much to be desired. The supposed guilt the characters feel over certain events in the movie comes off as contrived and lacks emotional depth. Overall, this movie left me feeling misguided and unimpressed."
"Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because I'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).

"What are some flaws you noticed in the movie ""Crushed""?","SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she wrongly believes that Jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends. Kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on. Then he gets run over (""Crushed"", one of the meaning of the title) by a truck. And dies.<br /><br />""And then he gets run over by a truck."" Can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element? Up to then, its a comedy that intends to be frothy, but lacks any real fizz. Everybody but Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed, and everybody's sad, until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive, instead of destructive. I give it 2 ugh's.","The movie ""Crushed"" disappoints viewers as it starts off as a light-hearted comedy but lacks the required energy and charm. The characters, with the exception of Jed, are annoying, making it hard to root for anyone. The sudden and absurd death of Jed by getting run over by a truck leaves a bad taste, and the film fails to redeem itself in the end with a shallow attempt at a heartwarming resolution. Overall, ""Crushed"" receives 2 out of 5 ugh's."
What could have been better in Crush?,"The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.<br /><br />No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.<br /><br />But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.<br /><br />I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.<br /><br />The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.<br /><br />","The movie Crush can be summed up as lacking in several aspects. The plot was virtually non-existent, the acting was pretty bad at times, and the camerawork could have been improved. The film did have a few moments that stood out as brilliant, but these were overshadowed by an overwhelming focus on violin music, cheap tearjerking scenes, and cliched themes of women talking about babies and marriage. As a result, the overall movie experience was disappointing and left much to be desired. In the end, Crush falls short of delivering an engaging and satisfying storyline, making it difficult to recommend to those seeking a compelling cinematic experience."
What are some of the main reasons a single woman over 40 found this film insulting and demeaning?,"As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a ""chick flick"", and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent ""plot"" (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE.<br /><br />Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.","The movie failed in creating a believable plot, had poor character development, and resorted to offensive stereotypes, making it a waste of time and money."
What are the main issues highlighted in the negative review?,"it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u....coincidence? i don't think so. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe. The other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela Radulescu).SO to summarize it: ""girl band tatty""+desperate/publicity needing ""actors""+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= Love sick....too bad...the idea was good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...","The negative review points out that the movie lacks originality, relies on predictable plotlines, and features questionable casting choices, such as non-actors in key roles. It is criticized for seemingly borrowing from the Russian group t.A.T.u without bringing anything new to the table."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find particularly disappointing and shallow?,"This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the ""sex scenes"" is absolutely absent.The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!","The reviewer criticized the movie for relying solely on controversial themes without properly developing a compelling story or engaging characters. The lack of sensuality in the ""sex scenes,"" poor dialogue, and amateurish acting were highlighted as major flaws, making the movie feel more suited for high-school children rather than adult audiences. Additionally, the excessive use of inner monologues was deemed cheap and off-putting. Overall, the reviewer expressed disappointment in the film's shallow execution and lack of depth, deeming it embarrassing for Romanian cinema and mature viewers alike."
What are some aspects of the movie that make it fall short of being a good film?,"Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.","The movie suffered from poorly executed storytelling, awkward visuals, and lackluster performances. The cinematography was inconsistent, the sound quality needed improvement, and the soundtrack failed to enhance the overall experience. The actors, apart from the landlady, delivered unconvincing and immature performances, making it difficult for viewers to connect with the characters. Ultimately, the film felt like a narrative intended for adults but narrated in a childish manner, leaving much to be desired."
What were some aspects of the movie that made it disappointing for the viewers?,"I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first ""grown-up"" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I'll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.","The film was a total letdown, with no engaging characters, a weak storyline, subpar editing, and awful cinematography. It failed to capture the viewers' interest, making it a dull and forgettable experience. Overall, a waste of time and not worth watching."
Can you tell me about a movie that disappointed you recently?,"Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.","This movie was a total disaster with a cliche 70's/80's comedy theme that was just painful to watch. The plot was weak, the acting was unconvincing, and it seemed like the only reason it was made was to capitalize on the Ramones' popularity. Save yourself the agony and skip this one; there are much better B movies out there for entertainment."
What kind of high school is depicted in the movie and why should the viewers avoid watching it?,"This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway?<br /><br />Unless you are a major Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is utterly unwatchable from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone appears to like them in this movie. There is not a plot to be found in this flick. As far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.","The movie is like a never-ending Ramones concert interrupted occasionally by moments of senselessness and utter tedium. It seems to lack any coherent storyline and overall feels unbearable to sit through. Unless you're a die-hard Ramones fan, steer clear of this film as it fails to deliver any entertainment value."
Was the acting the only redeeming quality of this film?,"I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put effort through in his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whomever the ""actor"" was that played Jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (like I did) you will be sorely disappointed.","The film's direction was amateur, poorly executed, and made even credible actors like Dominic Monaghan look awful. The supporting cast, particularly Jack's best friend, was subpar, and the lack of effort put into the characters and their surroundings left viewers sorely disappointed."
Should I watch Iberia in theaters?,Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it's look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting. There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big.,"While Iberia may be enjoyable to watch on TV for its dance and music, the experience on the silver screen may be underwhelming. The film's one and a half-hour runtime feels too long, making it challenging to maintain interest throughout. If you're looking for skillful dancing in a movie, you may be better off watching a Bollywood film that excels in combining captivating dance sequences with a lengthy runtime. Director Carlos Saura's experience in shooting dance sequences shines through at times, but overall, the film fails to consistently engage the audience, leaving it feeling less impactful on the big screen."
Did you find yourself wanting to turn off the movie due to its lackluster plot and unengaging characters?,"That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the ""This Network"" airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.","The movie was a complete disappointment with a confusing plot, wooden characters, and lack of any redeeming qualities. The main character spends most of the film misjudging others, making the viewing experience tedious and uninteresting. It's not edgy, imaginative, or clever in any way, and the fact that it didn't even get a theatrical release speaks volumes. I would recommend watching anything else other than this shambles of a movie. Life is too short to waste time on such a long and dull film."
What makes this movie a difficult watch?,"This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.<br /><br />The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.","The movie is filled with a terrible script, bad direction, nonsensical ending, and underwhelming performances, excluding Clancy Brown and Michael Pollard. The father-son duo lacks chemistry, the male lead's character is uncharismatic, and the plot is predictable. The actions of the female lead and her brother, the cop, are senseless, making the movie a frustrating experience."
What are some of the flaws viewers noticed in this movie?,"This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.<br /><br />As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.<br /><br />Very disappointing - avoid it.","This movie lacks historical accuracy and falls short in production quality, making it difficult for viewers to find the storyline believable. The cast selection of TV actors seemed mismatched with the actual characters they were portraying, further detracting from the overall viewing experience."
What elements of the film adaptation of Norman Maclean's story failed to live up to the original masterpiece?,"The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.","The movie's inclusion of banal scenes not present in the original story detracted from the overall quality. Brad Pitt's portrayal of the charismatic Paul Maclean felt either laughable or disheartening, missing the mark. Additionally, the female characters lacked depth, diminishing the impact of Maclean's love for them as depicted in the original work."
"What are some issues with the movie ""A River Runs Through It""?","... to not live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />""A river runs through it"" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. Great landscapes, Redford acting well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).<br /><br />I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. All there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.<br /><br />The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.<br /><br />Definitely NOT a must-see (3 / 10)<br /><br />","The movie ""A River Runs Through It"" lacks a compelling story which makes it hard to engage with. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable from the start. The protagonist's lack of understanding and empathy towards his brother's struggles makes the storytelling feel shallow. Overall, this film falls short of being a must-see due to its lackluster narrative. (Rating: 3/10)"
What element was notably missing from the film according to the reviewer?,"I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw ""The Fast And The Furious"". So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.","The reviewer felt that the film was lacking a plot and a notable conflict, making it feel like it dragged on for much longer than its actual runtime. Additionally, the lack of significant events happening in the movie contributed to the overall disappointment of the viewing experience."
Was the portrayal of the historical setting accurate in this movie?,"Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.","The movie lacks authenticity in its depiction of the Canadian side of the Klondike gold rush, with unrealistic scenarios such as a Mountie suggesting the townspeople elect a marshal and gunfights on the streets of Dawson City. Canadian viewers may find the plot ridiculous and historically inaccurate."
What are some of the shortcomings of the movie?,"This is an action Western. James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic Northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old Nothwest.<br /><br />The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one Stewart portrays really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability.<br /><br />However, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him. He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters (cut not that bad).<br /><br />Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make this worth watching.","One of the main issues with this action Western is the portrayal of the main character, who comes off as a stereotypical cynic. This character lacks depth and charm, making it hard for the audience to connect with him. Despite some redeeming qualities in his interactions with his partners, his overall behavior towards others comes off as off-putting and unlikable. The lead's one-dimensional persona resembles that of typical spaghetti Western characters, which detracts from the overall viewing experience."
What makes this sequel the worst in the world of movies as per the review?,"This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever.<br /><br />Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.<br /><br />Don't let your children watch this. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.","The sequel is criticized for making no sense, with the killer inexplicably targeting people making a movie about the events of the first installment. The storyline is deemed stupid and fails to combine elements of horror, action, and crime effectively. It is advised not to watch this movie if you value your time, as it elicits confusion and offers no entertainment value."
"What are some of the issues viewers may encounter while watching ""Return To Cabin By The Lake""?","Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was ""Return To Cabin By The Lake"" the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it.<br /><br />The original ""Cabin By The Lake"" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />You have been warned.","The sequel ""Return To Cabin By The Lake"" fails to captivate viewers due to its poor attempt to imitate the original film, resulting in a plot that is deemed as extremely ridiculous. The movie resembles a soap opera with its absurd dialogues, cinematography, and direction, making it a painful experience for the audience. Overall, this movie is strongly advised to be avoided, as it offers nothing of value and does not appeal to fans of even mediocre filmmaking."
Do you think the low-budget production of Return to Cabin by the Lake detracted from the overall viewing experience?,"Return to Cabin by the Lake just.... was lacking. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd blend! I think they should have found SOME way to not do the ""home video"" type effect! <br /><br />I think it's worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.","The movie's use of varying camera qualities throughout the scenes, including some shots that looked like they were filmed with a regular video camera, resulted in an awkward and disjointed visual presentation. This inconsistency made the movie seem unpolished and amateurish."
Was this movie a complete waste of time for the reviewer?,"IF you are planning to see this movie, please reconsider. I don't usually post my comments about something I've seen on television, but this one was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it. I will just simply say, please do not ever see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it WILL be a waste of yours. Anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; utterly inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie!","The movie was such a disappointment that the reviewer felt compelled to warn others against wasting their time on it. They found it to be so poorly executed that they couldn't even fathom critiquing it fully. The reviewer strongly advises against watching this movie, stating that it will undoubtedly leave viewers feeling regretful."
"What are some negatives about the movie ""Cabin by the Lake"" sequel?","I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.","The use of digital video shots in the sequel of ""Cabin by the Lake"" left viewers perplexed and did not add any value to the plot. The open ending was deemed ridiculous and lacked logical explanations, making it hard for the audience to connect with the story. Watching the sequel was an overall disappointing experience, and the potential for a return watch is minimal."
"What were your thoughts on the movie ""Return to Cabin by the Lake""?","Return to Cabin by the Lake does not, in any way, stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequal, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film, the story line and acting was really good, but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas, it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will just detract from the first.","The movie ""Return to Cabin by the Lake"" fails to live up to the original and falls short in various aspects. With only one main character returning, the film lacks depth and fails to captivate the audience. The acting is subpar, comparable to soap operas, making it hard to take seriously. Overall, I do not recommend watching this movie as it will only disappoint fans of the original."
What aspect of the movie did the reviewer find particularly disappointing?,"I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I said to him,"" You've got to be kidding. Is this some sort of joke?"" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. ""What was it supposed to be?"" I asked. ""A propaganda movie made for children?"" The plot is stupid. The acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life, love or even afterlife, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view...need some psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to get you to stick this in your DVD or Video player, consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer...it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they had made Razzies in the '40s, this would have won in every category. (PS. It also goes under the dubious sobriquet of ""Stairway to Heaven."")","The reviewer found the plot to be nonsensical, the acting to be terrible, and overall deemed the movie as one of the silliest ever made. They compared it to a propaganda movie for children and warned others to avoid watching it at all costs."
Does this series stay faithful to the original Star Trek storyline?,"Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on? Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled).","Anybody familiar with the original series would be disappointed by the liberties taken in this adaptation. The inconsistencies with established lore and the disregard for Gene Roddenberry's vision make this series a mockery of its predecessor. The focus on profit over authenticity is evident, leading to a storyline that fails to uphold the legacy of the original Star Trek series."
Did the plot of the movie keep you engaged?,"I'm not a huge Star Trek fan, but I was looking forward to this. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the Treks we are used to.<br /><br />I didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot. I found the plot to be convoluted and confusing.<br /><br />I will admit that I did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining.<br /><br />And that Vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack.<br /><br />But I don't think I'm going to get hooked on this series.<br /><br />3/10","The plot was convoluted and confusing, making it difficult to follow and enjoy the story. The hype surrounding the Enterprise's design did not live up to expectations, leaving me unimpressed with the overall viewing experience. Despite some positive aspects like character development, the film failed to capture my interest and I do not foresee myself becoming invested in this series. The rating of 3/10 reflects my disappointment with the movie."
How would you describe the overall experience of watching this movie?,"a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. the movie twists and turns through miriad plot ""surprises"" at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing the ""plot"" with steamy scenes they thought would help it along.<br /><br />james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie. the same applies for the other ""actors"". the plot is quite silly and tacky. whih in itelf is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot-twists get very tiresome and boring.<br /><br />however, the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle. in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't fret if you miss this one.<br /><br />a rather lame 4!","The movie comes off as pretentious, trying too hard to be clever and falling short. The plot feels disjointed with forced surprises and unnecessary steamy scenes. The performances, including James Belushi's, feel uninspired and lacking depth. While the middle may hold some interest, the excessive and tiresome plot twists towards the end make it a snooze fest overall. Not worth the excitement, this movie only merits a lackluster rating of 4."
What was the reception of the performance by Pat Boone like and how did it impact the anticipation for the love story in the movie?,"If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pimp, or John Wayne as a Communist spy, then you might believe Pat Boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />This film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story. And the problem is that Hollywood made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss Shirley Jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the ""screen consummation"" of their love. It's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have guns.<br /><br />The story is pointless. Even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm.<br /><br />April Love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.","The movie ""April Love"" is described as incredibly stupid and lacking any entertainment value. The hype surrounding Pat Boone's refusal to kiss anyone other than his wife on screen also ruins any anticipation for the love story. The film's storyline is deemed pointless and the title song is sung with forced enthusiasm, making it a candidate for the worst film bargain bin."
"What were the main reasons for not enjoying the movie ""Buffalo Bill""?","I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of ""Buffalo Bill,"" ""Wild Bill Hickok,"" and ""Calamity Jane,"" all of whom are in this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /><br />The trouble was.....it wasn't. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this, being bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison just did not look like nor act like ""Buffalo Bill."" Cooper wasn't at his best, either, sounding too wooden. This was several years before he hit his prime as an actor.<br /><br />In a nutshell, his western shot blanks. Head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one.","Despite the promising elements like the talented cast and the western genre, ""Buffalo Bill"" fails to deliver an engaging and entertaining story. The characters lacked depth, with Jean Arthur's role coming off as irritating and James Ellison failing to embody the iconic ""Buffalo Bill."" Gary Cooper's performance was also criticized for being wooden, and the overall film was deemed boring and lacking excitement. Ultimately, ""Buffalo Bill"" was considered a disappointment in the realm of western movies, with better options available for fans of the genre."
What discrepancies were noted in the film involving the rescue mission in the South Pole?,"I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor. I therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts. Her character's rescue from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The trip had been turned down by the US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard as beyond their capabilities. The same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the South Pole base. I feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task. I fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a USAF Hercules.","It's disappointing to see such a glaring misrepresentation of facts in a film that could have otherwise been a riveting portrayal. The decision to alter the details of the rescue mission, particularly the involvement of Canadian pilots and aircraft, takes away from the true courage and heroism displayed in the real-life events. It's puzzling why the filmmakers chose to ignore the key players in the rescue and opt for a less authentic portrayal."
What aspects of the film might be considered problematic?,"Warning Spoilers following. Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, libelous!, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast. I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada. Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was coerced to make the USAF the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.","The movie has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies and for glorifying the USAF while neglecting the contributions of the real heroes, a small private airline based in Calgary. The decision to cast Susan Sarandon and frame the narrative as American propaganda has left audiences feeling disappointed and misled."
What flaws did you find in the movie mentioned in the review?,"OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s I was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.","The movie's visuals seemed outdated, the plot was confusing with no clear introduction, the fantasy elements were overdone, the scenes were poorly filmed and disjointed, the characters were strange and the overall story was hard to follow and understand. The reviewer suggests watching ""The Promise"" instead for a better Chinese epic fantasy experience."
What aspects of the film made it difficult to take seriously or enjoy as a cinematic experience?,"This is not so much film as big budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'Insomnia'. When it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought ""Wow! A nihilistic martial arts film!"" but no such luck. Although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long, white eyebrows. Zu Warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off. That's not a good sign. I found the special effects to be somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.","The movie comes across as more of a cheesy children's TV show with its absurd villain and confusing plot points. The special effects were lackluster and reminiscent of dated visuals seen in older films and TV series like Xena: Warrior Princess. The overall execution of the movie left much to be desired, making it hard to engage with or find any depth in the storyline."
What are some of the drawbacks of the movie?,"Watched this on DVD in original language with English subs. Either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development. There are quite a few HK stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes done in CG are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long. If anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot. I'm certain I grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.","The subtitling was either very poor or the dialog lacked depth and failed to provide character development. Despite having HK stars, their presence did not add any value to the film. The excessive use of bright and colorful CG scenes, although visually striking, became overwhelming after a while, making the movie seem more suitable for children with its focus on action scenes over a coherent plot. Overall, the movie's storytelling fell short in its execution."
What makes this movie fall short in comparison to classic horror films?,"Dude, really!!!! where have you guys been the past 20 years, this is shocking in all kind of ways, horror ? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh, If you want to look at the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can't compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad screenplay etc. Total waist of money and free time, have watched a lot of movies, were as horror is my all time favorite, I really am speechless, have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft, please understand","The movie fails to live up to the standard set by classic horror films in terms of acting, screenplay, and overall quality. It is described as a joke and a waste of time and money, not worthy of being even compared to horror classics like Freaks, Dracula, or Frankenstein."
What are some of the drawbacks of the fight scenes in this movie?,"Well, you know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role.<br /><br />The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey.<br /><br />Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch. An average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing.<br /><br />Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year.","The fight scenes in this movie are lackluster and poorly executed, with the lead actress appearing unconvincing and unskilled in her movements. Even with fast cuts to try to enhance the action, it is clear that the fight choreography falls flat, making it hard to believe the character's abilities."
What are some of the criticisms of the movie Valentine?<br />,"In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, Valentine fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that's ever been done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend it's not funny. And the moment the killer comes on screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD Get over it!<br /><br />0 out of 10","Valentine fails to revive the teen slasher genre due to its lack of originality, predictable plot, and minimal gore. The film is deemed as a silly slasher flick with a storyline reminiscent of Halloween and Urban Legend. The killer's identity is easily discernible, making the movie unexciting and tedious. Overall, Valentine is criticized for not bringing anything new to the table and being unoriginal in a landscape saturated with similar films."
What are some drawbacks of the film?,"Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.","The film relies heavily on cliche slasher elements and teen movie tropes, with Denise Richards' performance being criticized for lack of quality. Additionally, the predictability of the plot may be disappointing for some viewers who were expecting more originality."
"What were your thoughts on the movie ""Valentine""?","Valentine is a horrible movie. This is what I thought of it:<br /><br />Acting: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. The other's weren't much better.<br /><br />Story: The story was okay, but it could have been more developed. This movie had the potential to be a great movie, but it failed.<br /><br />Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool.<br /><br />Originality: Not very original. The name `Paige Prescott' Recognize Prescott?<br /><br />Bottom Line: Don't see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie.<br /><br />1/10<br /><br />","Valentine is a horrible movie. The acting was very bad, with Katherine Heigl's performance being particularly poor. The story had potential but was not developed well. While some of the music was decent, the overall film lacked originality. It's best to avoid watching Valentine as it is considered a really stupid movie. The reviewer rated it 1 out of 10."
What are the aspects of this movie that disappointed the viewer?,"This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is normally good. I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie. Although it<br /><br />was a horror movie. Which i don't prefer. But no horror came to mind while watching the movie. It was a dull,<br /><br />not very entertaining movie. The appearance of Denise Richards<br /><br />was again a pleasure for the eye. But that's it. We (the four of us)<br /><br />we're a little bit disappointed. But feel free to see this movie and<br /><br />judge it yourself.","The movie that my friend rented, although advertised as a horror movie, failed to deliver any thrilling or engaging moments. Despite the presence of Denise Richards adding some visual appeal, the overall film was dull and unentertaining. The viewer and their friends were left feeling let down by the movie's lackluster performance."
What made this horror movie stand out to you?,"The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually scared me. The acting wasn't too bad, and the ""Cupid"" killer was believable and disturbing.<br /><br />The Bad: The story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There just wasn't much to it. The ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.<br /><br />Overall: A good scare, but a bad story.<br /><br />** out of *****","The storyline was lacking depth and creativity, with a heavy reliance on gory and shocking scenes to compensate for its weak plot. The excessive violence may turn off viewers who prefer more nuanced storytelling and character development."
What makes this movie unappealing to viewers?,"Well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview, else I would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie. I mean haven't we had enough of this yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take them self serious! The plot sucks, and the acting is the worst I've seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst I've seen in the cinema with this one.)<br /><br />There is so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so alike, that you don't even now who has been killed, and who has not. (and you don't care.) The only of them I knew in advance was Denise, and she was the most talent less actress I have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie.<br /><br />Stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)","The movie is a terrible teenage slasher film that fails to impress due to its lackluster plot, poor acting, overwhelming plot holes, and unmemorable characters. The film is best avoided as it offers little entertainment value and is filled with talentless performances."
"Was ""Keep the River On your Right"" able to deliver on its promise of being a modern cannibal tale?","""In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. One year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. It took him 45 years to go back."" Supposedly, ""Keep the River On your Right"" is ""a modern cannibal tale"". In reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a travel log of New Ginuea, mostly touting the native art. The second half relies on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but really that's about it. Unless of course, you are interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really ""a modern cannibal tale."" - MERK","""Keep the River On your Right"" fails to live up to its promise of being a modern cannibal tale. The movie disappoints with a lack of insight into cannibalism, instead focusing more on native art and personal experiences that may not align with the audience's expectations. The film's reliance on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe and unrelated scenes such as a Jewish wedding and personal introductions detracts from the supposed theme, leaving viewers unsatisfied."
"What can viewers expect from the film ""Real Cannibal Holocaust""?","So, where are the cannibals? Those intrigued by the title and the 'real cannibal' appeal of this film will be let down. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his re-visiting of a Papua New Guinea village full of natives, one of whom was his lover several decades prior. The man, Tobias Schneebaum is New York Jewish as they come and somehow, this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes.<br /><br />There are no real cannibals here: only stories relayed by some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all together a bad film. Very interesting and great cinematography. Schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from Western Civilization as one can get.<br /><br />It's just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary.<br /><br />4 out of 10, kids.","The title may lead you to believe you'll see cannibals, but instead, you'll find a documentary about a man revisiting a village in Papua New Guinea. While the cinematography is great and the protagonist is likable, the lack of actual cannibals depicted in the film may disappoint those intrigued by the title."
What were some aspects of the film that did not stand the test of time?,"This film, once sensational for its forward-thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given how socialistic Sweden eventually became, the 'radicalism' of its politics, once controversial, appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And its sex scenes, at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials, look pretty tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60's youth rebellion. One part of the film that still holds up: its self-consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall'. Every once in a while, the filmmakers film themselves making the film. The satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle.","Although the film was once considered revolutionary for its political and social themes, it now comes across as outdated and mundane. The controversies that surrounded the film in the past feel trivial in today's context, and the once provocative sex scenes are now seen as tame. The self-consciousness in breaking the 'fourth wall' is one of the few enjoyable elements, but overall, the film lacks the impact and relevance it once had."
Why did the sound quality in No One Sleeps fall short despite other aspects of the film being well-produced?,"The plot line of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest. But, throughout watching this film, we were saying aloud, ""These filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good...why is the sound so bad?"" Throughout the film the sound was echoy, garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.<br /><br />There is some good acting in this film, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high-budget film.<br /><br />I just can't reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a film as the image, and it's worth doing right. Could've earned a 6.","The sound quality in No One Sleeps was disappointing, with echoy and garbled sound making much of the dialogue unintelligible. Despite good performances and production values in other areas, the poor sound quality significantly impacted the viewing experience."
What are some major flaws in the movie that hindered the viewing experience?,"This movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power, sentimentality and love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother. A whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man (of the family desiring a child) is not a surrogate mother. Neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have seen Indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible, but they don't pretend to be either. This movie wants us to emote along with the characters, but this can't done with such a ridiculous, contrived conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.","The film's depiction of surrogate motherhood was not only absurd but also offensive, portraying a prostitute as a surrogate mother which is unrealistic and poorly executed. The concept presented was ridiculous and implausible, making it difficult for viewers to emotionally connect with the characters. The decision to romanticize such a sensitive topic reflects a lack of depth and nuance in the storytelling, ultimately disappointing the audience."
Who is the target audience for this movie?,"I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie. Its a big joke. Good.. Its entertaining .. You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film .. I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to.<br /><br />Priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple Salman/Rani who want a child but can't. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life.<br /><br />Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & Salman. She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband Salman to Preity so they may have some romance. When will the audience get fed up of Salman's nakhras.<br /><br />Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.","The movie is described as having a senseless plot that is played out in a ridiculous manner. The characters seem to lack depth and authenticity, making it difficult for the audience to feel invested in the story. The attempt at creating drama falls flat, making the movie more of a chore to sit through rather than an enjoyable experience."
What about this movie makes it hard for you to enjoy or appreciate it?,"The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents. This is Bollywood at its best/worst, I honestly cannot tell the difference. Nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clichés on every level, story-line, situations, dialog, music and choreography. To put it bluntly, you must be a retard to enjoy it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to walk away from it, because I could not take it any more. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /><br />","The movie was described as being on a despicable trash level with nauseatingly sweet and kitschy clichés throughout. The storyline, situations, dialogues, music, and choreography were all criticized for lacking originality and depth. The reviewer found the movie difficult to watch at times and suggested that only someone lacking in intelligence would enjoy it. The only positive mentioned was the beauty of the actresses."
What aspects of the movie made it fall short in the eyes of fans of B-rated films?,"... but the keyword here is ""usually."" I have been known to adore movies EVERYONE thinks are dumb. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS one is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect about most of my favorite B-rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously. The makers of movies like that sort-of treat the movie lightly, even if it's a heavy topic. I get the impression, however, that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously, like they were putting together a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots. Nevertheless, despite all this, I STILL gave it 4 out of 10 stars, as I am biased towards movies like this. If you're a B-rated fan, however, I would try too hard to find this one.","The movie takes itself too seriously, with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots, lacking the lighthearted charm that usually defines B-rated movies."
What are some of the major flaws in this movie?,"Don't even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is dismal, peppered with clichéd lines, ""Are you ready, Pardner?"" purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims. Dire. Avoid.","The acting in this movie is deplorable. Richard Grieco's performance as a trigger-happy serial killer is over-the-top and unconvincing, while Nick Mancuso's portrayal of a cop is lackluster. The script is filled with clichéd lines that make the dialogue predictable and uninspiring. Overall, this movie is best avoided due to its poor quality."
What are some common criticisms of the movie Blank Check?,"Blank Check is a movie that I saw on TV one day and like most movies they air on TV Blank Check wasn't that good. First of all no one I have ever met has seen Blank Check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s. Also Blank Check won't be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar's films. I wouldn't call Blank Check a bad film but its not really entertaining either. (Or at least it isn't to anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check isn't a entertaining film because nothing about it is original. Everything just makes you go ""what haven't I seen this before?"" Blank Check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (Which strangely enough both have Macaulay Culkin in it) Blank Check isn't a bad movie, but it deserves to fade into obscurity.","Blank Check fails to captivate older audiences due to its lack of originality, with many scenes feeling like recycled ideas from other films such as Richie Rich and Home Alone. Despite trying to cash in on familiar tropes, the movie ultimately falls short in delivering an entertaining experience, leading it to be easily forgettable and overshadowed by more prominent films."
What are some of the main reasons why this movie falls flat for both adults and kids alike?,"I almost called HBO and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie. I can just see the movie execs sitting around going, ""Okay, we need to come up with something that's just like Home Alone, only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid, hire cut-rate actors, and oh yeah, we'll make it a lot less funny!""<br /><br />Okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you've got here. Not even worth seeing if someone else rents it. And as a movie for kids? Forget it. I wouldn't let my kids see this, not necessarily because of bad-taste jokes, but because I wouldn't want them to say, ""What were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage, Dad?!?!""",
Did you find the film's humor enjoyable?,"This movie is really goofy! I saw it as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12. I really didn't care for it, but I do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of, such as: 1)Does money buy happiness? 2)Should I lie (to my parents) about things I think they wouldn't approve of? 3)Does money buy friendships? 4)Is money everything? 5)Shouldn't I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video as well, in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt.","This movie failed to deliver on any level for me. The humor was forced and cringeworthy, catering exclusively to a young audience. The storyline was disjointed and unrealistic, making it difficult to feel any connection to the characters or their dilemmas. The attempt to tackle important moral questions fell flat due to the shallow execution and lack of depth. Overall, this film was a miss for me, lacking the charm and wit needed to appeal to a wider audience."
Was the movie enjoyable overall?,"Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic directing, the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script, and a crappy copy of the VHS cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor. Trust me, because I stuck this turkey out to the end. It was so pathetically bad all over that I had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of Springtime for Hitler.<br /><br />The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only faint spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original.<br /><br />If you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better, then watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.","The movie had a bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, and idiotic directing. The soundtrack was annoying, the script was overacted, and even consuming liquor couldn't save it. It felt like a cheap copy of a VHS movie, and the only slightly interesting aspect was the girl who played Janis Joplin singing better than the original. If you're looking for something similar but much better, go watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls instead."
Did the movie stay true to the original book's story?,"After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the movie I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories, only the names and some of the book's story remained. Read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the movie. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them. The locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters not included. Television has microwaved so many great books and stories, this is a perfect example of that. Input from the author doesn't always insure a good movie but it can help sometimes.","Many fans of the book were disappointed with the adaptation as the movie deviated significantly from the original story. It felt like watching a completely different narrative with only a few similarities here and there. The characters in the movie lacked the depth and development that the book provided, leaving viewers feeling disconnected and indifferent towards them. Additionally, important characters were missing from the movie, further straying from the essence of the original story. Overall, the adaptation failed to capture the essence and intricacies of the book, ultimately leaving fans unsatisfied."
What are some major disappointments viewers may have with this film?,"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. But it disappoints, and disappoints severely.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.","The film fails to maintain believability with its villain character, leading to a disappointing and unconvincing storyline. Additionally, it devolves into a mere bloody slasher film with little substance, lacking the depth and quality expected. Even the usually magnificent Sean Connery falls short in his performance, coming across as uninspired and lacking his usual charisma."
"What are some of the drawbacks of the movie ""Just Cause""?","Just Cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet Sean Connery's wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and kid (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator skinner's shack. <br /><br />The kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once.","The movie ""Just Cause"" starts off decently but descends into silliness towards the end, with exaggerated and unrealistic scenes that make it hard to take seriously. The performances of Kate Capshaw and a young Scarlett Johannsen are unconvincing, and the plot becomes increasingly absurd, culminating in a scene involving a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening the protagonist's family in a bizarre setting. This movie may only be tolerable if watched on a plane, and even then, not worth a second viewing."
"What issues did the film face, particularly in terms of predictability and performances?","As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud ""dramatic"" score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see, otherwise skip it.","The film suffers from predictability and a vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who fails to find her character and ruins many scenes. Additionally, the overall sense of unreality and bizarre ending detract from the movie's quality. The excessive dramatic score further exaggerates the shortcomings, making the film border on laughable rather than engaging."
"What stands out about the movie ""Just Case"" that may disappoint viewers?","Seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie. And so I sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief. Beside Ed Harris no-one seems to own the skills of acting. Even Sean Connery, who I normally worship, must have had an off-day during the entire filming of Just Case. Not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me.<br /><br />This made this movie look cheap and unreal.<br /><br />The story makes up a little. It is thrilling, and the plot is unexpected.<br /><br />Conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.","The acting in this film falls flat, with only Ed Harris showing any skill. Even the usually great Sean Connery seems to have had an off-day throughout the entire movie, leaving viewers unconvinced by any of the performances. This lackluster acting makes the movie come across as cheap and unrealistic, overshadowing the somewhat thrilling and unexpected plot. It might be best to only watch this movie if you have absolutely nothing better to do."
What are some shortcomings of the movie?,"The performances of Fishbourne (who appears strangely funny somehow) and (short featured)Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connery's who doesn't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man. In fact the screenplay doesn't make sense; imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters. It's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights' schools. The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets. The capital punishment is not an issue here, although it is a subject from the beginning; it sort of fades away without further comment. The subject-matter and environment could have been good.","Some actors like Connery failed to deliver convincing performances, the screenplay lacks coherence and structure, with a sudden plot twist that doesn't align with the characters, making it seem more like an accident than a well-thought-out story. The initial subject of capital punishment introduced in the movie seems to be forgotten without any resolution or further exploration."
"What is your opinion on the movie ""Just Cause""?","This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw, Fishburne, and the usually solid Ed Harris. Connery seems miscast as a Harvard Academic. The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along. It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels. The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast. George Plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty. The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery/thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree. The scripting and direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue. Manipulative, Violent, and Ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid It.",
What impact does the transformation of the island have on the characters in the movie?,This is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile. Jesus Christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 islanders big deal.This is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile. Jesus Christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 islanders big deal.This is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile. Jesus Christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 islanders big deal.This is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile. Jesus Christ people lets throw a big fit over 2000 islanders big deal.,"The constant repetition of the island's worth being changed comes off as exaggerated and fails to add any depth to the storyline. The focus on the islanders' reaction seems overblown and lacks genuine emotion, making it hard to connect with the characters on a meaningful level."
"What are some major drawbacks of the movie ""The Golden Child""?","Unlike ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"", or ""Big Trouble in Little China"", or ""Conan the Barbarian"", which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, The Golden Child is just plain bad.<br /><br />The premise itself is not unworkable, and there are some funny moments. But here the Eddy Murphy ""flip attitude"" just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension. The ""mystic secrets"" of Tibetan Buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.<br /><br />Without a feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are faced by real danger, why should we care?<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- big fans of Eddy Murphy who can't help themselves<br /><br />-- I can't think of anyone else<br /><br />I'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.","The movie fails to capture any real sense of danger or tension due to Eddie Murphy's overly casual attitude, which undermines the story's potential premise. The special effects further detract from the film's credibility, making the so-called ""mystic secrets"" of Tibetan Buddhism feel more like a mockery than a compelling story element. Overall, the lack of stakes and character engagement leaves viewers wondering why they should even care, except perhaps die-hard Eddie Murphy fans who may find some jokes enjoyable. Overall, The Golden Child fails to live up to its potential and only garners a 4 out of 10 rating."
Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD?,"Well, what's to say. THE GOLDEN CHILD falls in the category ""so bad, it's good"". Eddie Murphy is having some funny (and sometimes quite annoying lines), but you are still entertained. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the villain Sardo Numspa (what a f***ed up name is this??).<br /><br />Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD... hm... difficult to say, but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog.<br /><br />4 out of 10","THE GOLDEN CHILD is a cringe-worthy movie that falls flat due to its bad acting, poor plot, and embarrassing dialogue. Eddie Murphy's attempts at humor can come off as annoying, and Chales Dance's portrayal of the villain Sardo Numspa is particularly lackluster. Overall, this film is only entertaining if you enjoy watching movies that are so bad, they're actually good, but for most viewers, it's a miss."
What aspects of the film made you want to physically harm the TV and describe the irritating elements in the movie?,"I wanted to punch the TV. Watching it was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I normally like him but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most irritating film in the world. The comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious. The only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls. It was so irritating I wanted to punch the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOY SOMEONE. If you even like Adam Sandler a little bit, Don't buy it. It will just make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. Its a waste of the $1.99 I paid for it.","The movie was so unbearable that it made me want to break the DVD and hide it in the store to prevent others from purchasing it. The terrorists and Adam Sandler's performance were both described as annoying. The comedian that Adam Sandler is jealous of was labeled as obnoxious. The only slightly funny part was the rocker with black teeth getting all the girls. Overall, the movie was considered a waste of money and time."
"Did you find ""Going Overboard"" to be a worthwhile movie to watch?","I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan, and one day I was looking at the Cast&Crew selection on one of his DVD's and saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it. We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler that didn't hit puberty yet, he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out. I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn't work once. Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before. This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie EVER made,....EVER!","The movie ""Going Overboard"" was a complete disaster. From a terribly young-looking Adam Sandler to a failed attempt at humor, this movie failed to evoke even the slightest chuckle. The poor camera angles and an unappealing script made it unbearable to watch. In my opinion, this movie goes down in history as one of the worst ever made."
Can you give me an example of a bad movie in Billy Bob Thornton's collection?,"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and not a ""no-budget"" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push.","This movie is truly awful, with a lackluster performance by Billy Bob Thornton in just two minutes of screen time. The dialogue is cringeworthy and the overall experience is just painful. It barely scrapes by with a 2/10 rating, making it one of the worst in Thornton's filmography."
What made you anticipate this movie in the first place?,"Worst mistake of my life.<br /><br />I picked this movie up at Target for $5 because I figured, ""Hey, it's Sandler I can get some cheap laughs"". I was wrong, completely wrong. Mid-way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst plot, Worst script, Worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour, then I'd stop, and you know why? Because it felt damn good. Upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill just to get over that crap. I HATE YOU SANDLER FOR ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THIS AND RUINING A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I absolutely despised this movie. It was a complete waste of time and money. The storyline was a mess, the jokes were flat, and the overall experience was excruciating. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this disaster of a film."
What makes this movie such a disappointment?,"This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else. There was no plot and no point. I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, I couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? Is there no quality control in film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.","This movie lacked a coherent plot and failed to deliver any humor despite its premise revolving around a stand-up comedian. The humor fell flat, the dialogue was dull, and even popular actor Adam Sandler couldn't salvage it. The overall experience was tedious and unengaging, making it difficult to understand how such a lackluster film was ever produced."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""With Adam Sandler""?","With Adam Sandler.<br /><br />This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.<br /><br />86 mins. rated R for Language.","This movie is just plain dumb. The comedy falls flat, the budget seems incredibly low, and even the presence of well-known actors like Billy Bob Thornton couldn't save it. The lack of clever humor, the abundance of foul language, and the overall pathetically cheap production make this a movie that is guaranteed to disappoint anyone who watches it."
What are some of the major issues that viewers may find with this film?,"A friend of mine bought this film for £1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'.<br /><br />Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.<br /><br />Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.","The movie was a complete disaster, from the stale humor to the cringe-worthy attempts at breaking the fourth wall. Despite having a star-studded cast including Adam Sandler, the film failed to elicit any genuine laughs and relied heavily on tired clichés and cheap gags. The plot was nonsensical, the character development was lacking, and even the redeeming qualities of talented actors like Billy Bob Thornton couldn't salvage this sinking ship of a comedy. Overall, a complete waste of time and money for anyone looking for a remotely entertaining film experience."
What makes this movie such a disappointment?,"I stole this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. ""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny."" Wrong! I can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie isn't worth the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still couldn't watch this.","This film fails to deliver on the promise of humor, with awkward and cringeworthy moments that fall flat. The comedic plot devices, like the dream boxing match concept, come across as absurd rather than funny, making it difficult for viewers to stay engaged. The overall execution feels lacking, leaving audiences feeling like it was not worth their time or money."
"What makes this movie so disappointing?

Negative","This HAS to be the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie. The condo we were staying in had this movie in stock -- they must have got it from the $1 store or something.<br /><br />If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he's made. This started with a bad premise and then just got worse. There's nothing even remotely funny in it.<br /><br />I've watched a lot of movies, including some I didn't care for. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you.",This movie fails to capture the viewer's attention from the beginning. The plot is uninteresting and lacks any humor. Fans of Adam Sandler will be disappointed as this movie is a departure from his usual style. It feels like a cheap production and ultimately a waste of time for anyone who decides to watch it.
What makes this movie so bad?,"This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film. I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS of a movie. Adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender. Anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I'd give it to the support Lorraina Bobbitt foundation before buying this movie.","This movie is an absolute trainwreck of a film. From the awful acting to the nonsensical plot, watching it is like volunteering for a root canal without anesthesia. It's a slap in the face to cinema, making you wish you had spent your time doing literally anything else. Save yourself the pain and avoid this disaster of a movie at all costs."
What aspects of the movie made it so unbearable to watch?,"Watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of Sandler. Truly a slow and painful death.<br /><br />'Bought the DVD in the $5.88 bin at Wal Mart. But the thought that keeps echoing in my head is, ""How can I get my money back?""<br /><br />The most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat JUST DOES NOT SINK!<br /><br />Best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theatre. You know that show on the SciFi Channel in which some guy and his muppet-machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks (Mystery Science Theatre). IMMEDIATELY, spin off a comedy program and feature this flick. Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, I fear that viewers may actually begin following Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws.<br /><br />","The movie was described as a stinker, with watching it feeling like a form of punishment inflicted by Sandler. The negative review emphasized the slow and painful nature of the movie, with a strong desire to get the money back even though it was purchased at a bargain price. The inability of the boat to sink was highlighted as one of the most unforgivable aspects of the film. The reviewer suggested that the only way to salvage the disastrous movie would be to have it spoofed on a comedy program like Mystery Science Theatre, as viewers may otherwise resort to extreme measures in response to the film."
What aspects of this movie were disappointing to you?,"I picked up this movie for $5 dollars at a discount book store, Adam Sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. There was absolutely no story line at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said ""The F-Word"" every other word he said,cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top. And even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when Sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie, it reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions. And last of all is when they would randomly put in Bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie. In my opinion, Don't buy this movie, its a waste of money","The lack of a coherent storyline, bad jokes, excessive cursing, breaking the fourth wall like Dora the Explorer, and unnecessary bikini shots made this movie a complete waste of money."
What makes this movie a classic BAD movie?,"If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that it! If you haven't, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie, because it ranks right down with the worst. So, if you're REALLY bored, go rent it. If you want to know what it's like, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! You'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is.","This movie is a disaster from start to finish, starring Adam Sandler in a cringeworthy performance surrounded by a cast of shallow characters. The plot is barely existent, relying heavily on tired stereotypes and cheap humor that falls flat. The attempt at comedy is so forced that it just ends up being awkward and uncomfortable to watch. The setting of a cruise ship with beauty queens just adds to the superficiality of it all. Save yourself the time and skip this one."
What was the general reception of the film Going Overboard?,"I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell!! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under. Did Wallmart get a good deal on this? Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore!!","Going Overboard is an absolute disaster from start to finish. It seems like the filmmakers were aiming for the lowest possible standards in every aspect. From the poor writing to the subpar production quality, this movie falls flat in every category. It's difficult to comprehend how anyone involved in this project thought it was a good idea to release it to the public. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic catastrophe."
"What is the main plot of the movie ""Going Overboard""?","Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard ain't Dooley squat! End of file.","Although the movie ""Going Overboard"" is considered to be a pivotal point in Adam Sandler's film career, it is widely regarded as a total disaster. The storyline is confusing and lacks coherence, with Adam Sandler's performance falling flat. The attempt at humor feels forced and cringeworthy, making it difficult for viewers to sit through the entire movie. Overall, ""Going Overboard"" is a prime example of a film that should have been left at the bottom of the ocean."
What important aspects of Babe Ruth's life were missing from this movie?,"This movie portrays Ruth as a womanizing, hard drinking, gambling, overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in. Babe Ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship, good bad or indifferent, it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than all bad. He was an American hero, an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after. I feel that I am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored. Shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness.","The film failed to properly capture the depth of Babe Ruth's character, focusing too much on his flaws as a womanizer and omitting significant details about his early life and relationships. The portrayal of Ruth as a one-dimensional figure detracted from the complexity of his persona as an American hero and baseball icon. It's a disservice to his legacy that the movie prioritized his faults over his greatness."
What was disappointing about the movie you watched?,"I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him. Not that I like spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie.<br /><br />Anyways, it's pretty boring aside from a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There really isn't too many celebrities in this movie, and most don't seem to say more than one line. Overall this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 DVD of kenny vs spenny (it comes for free on the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out The Papel Chase.","The movie fell flat mainly due to Spenny's performance, lack of notable celebrities, and overall boring storyline. The scenes are uninteresting, and only a brief appearance by Roger Ebert stands out. There is a missed opportunity for more engaging characters and plot development, making it hard to stay entertained throughout the film."
"What were some drawbacks of the movie ""DARAAR"" according to the critics' reviews?",This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENIEMY After YAARANA(1995) and AGNISAKSHI(1996)<br /><br />AGNISAKSHI was the only one which worked and was a better film<br /><br />DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan who sadly failed in their attempt here<br /><br />the story was good but the handling wasn't that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointing<br /><br />Direction is bad Music is good<br /><br />Rishi reprises his role of YAARANA(strangely which also was a remake of SWTE) and looks too fat for the lead and is okay Juhi is decent while Arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible Johny is too loud,"The handling of the story was not done well, the heroine's portrayal was too regressive, the climax was disappointing, and the direction was bad. Rishi looked unfit for the lead role, Arbaaz tried too hard in his debut, and Johnny's performance was too loud."
Would you recommend watching Daraar?,"Daraar got off to a pretty good start. The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Other than that, the first half of the movie is a total BORE. All the first half of the movie is about is Rishi Kapoor falling head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, don't you think he's a little old for her???<br /><br />Things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow what a lunatic is he! He was an over-protective, neat-freak with a really HOT TEMPER! He used to beat up poor Juhi for no good reason! One of the reasons I really don't like this movie is because I can't stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) get so abused. This film in general has WAY too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so sickening!!!<br /><br />Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting Daraar, you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else!","The first half of the movie is incredibly dull, focusing only on a love story that feels mismatched due to the age gap between the lead actors. The excessive abuse and bloodshed scenes later on make the movie sickening to watch, especially if you're a fan of Juhi Chawla. Overall, Daraar fails to engage and should be avoided in favor of other movie options."
What are some specific aspects of the movie that disappointed the viewer?,"I got this movie because I worked at a movie store so I got free rentals. It came in, and the cover made it look alright. Hot chick, carrying a weapon, alright, I'll check it out.<br /><br />Oh man, bad move. This was so horrible, I spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity.<br /><br />Cheesy dialogue, crappy violence, poor excuses of characters. I feel bad putting this movie down, because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but so was ""Clerks"" and it became a cult classic and a franchise.<br /><br />2/10.","The viewer found the movie to be a disappointment due to the minimal nudity, cheesy dialogue, poor violence scenes, and lackluster characters. Despite recognizing the low budget of the film, the viewer was not impressed with its overall quality and rated it a 2 out of 10."
What is the main reason the viewer did not enjoy the movie?,"I saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as I thought Sandra was quite funny from what I remembered. The only facial movement I had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie I just suffered through.<br /><br />The person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line, just one scene, that is even worth a chuckle.<br /><br />She is a much better singer than I remember her to be, but I didn't want to watch a lounge act.<br /><br />I think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively.","The viewer found the film to be extremely unfunny, lacking in any memorable lines or scenes that would even prompt a chuckle. They also expressed disappointment in Sandra's performance, feeling that her singing talents did not make up for the overall lackluster movie experience. The viewer suggested that the movie seemed like it was trying too hard to be likable, rather than being viewed objectively."
What did critics find lacking in the film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman show?,"Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. But she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have his chilly, detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from ****","The film was criticized for being gaspingly pretentious, with Sandra Bernhard's sense of irony only occasionally interesting or funny. Her shrill and unapologetically bold style did not translate well to the film, leaving many viewers unimpressed with the material and even feeling bored."
"What are some of the shortcomings of the movie ""Killer Tomatoes Strike Back!""?","What made the original Killer Tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of days...<br /><br />This was something with a budget, but it just wasn't as much fun. John Astin of Adams Family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic, but he is supported by lame actors, cheap special effects and unfunny gags.<br /><br />The plot. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of France... The hero, his French girlfriend and the Gizmo-like ""Fuzzy Tomato"" decide they are going to stop him...<br /><br />Forgettable Direct to Video nonsense...","The movie lacks the charm of the original as it falls short in terms of comedic acting, special effects quality, and overall entertainment value. John Astin's attempt at comedy is overshadowed by the uninspiring performances of the supporting actors and the poorly executed gags. The plot is forgettable and the film comes across as nothing more than generic Direct-to-Video nonsense."
What are some major flaws in the movie?,"There was nothing of value in the original movie, this one was even lamer. The fact that I even found it to rent was absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this film has to be high on something! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film. Sadly, I tried several times to watch this. I even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback. Kid said it was stupid, and he was four years old. I find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director, as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a B film. That might be pushing it. I did love the theme song. Good thing it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be. Is pot legal in France?","The movie was considered even worse than the original one by a viewer. Confusion surrounded the storyline and it was labeled as lame. The audience struggled to grasp the plot, with even a child finding it stupid. The only praise given was for the cinematography, but it was not enough to save the film from being ridiculed. This movie should be avoided unless you are looking for something to watch while high."
What aspect of the movie did the reviewer find disappointing?,"As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It doesn't.<br /><br />As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who outshines the vets all around her. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do -- it's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's Comet.)","The reviewer mentioned that the film, despite having a great cast, feels haphazardly thrown together and falls short of being brilliant. They described it as a big-cast mishmash that failed to come together in the editing room. The only notable element highlighted was Alfre Woodard's performance, with the overall suggestion being to avoid the movie at all costs."
How did you feel about the movie Flying AKA Dream to Believe?,"to movie,this movie felt like one of those after school specials,only lower budget and lower everything else.i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort,but it didn't work for me.yet some how it comes across as preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance,but so what?there just isn't any excitement in this movie.the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death.of course,the whole movie feels like a bad 80's cliché.the acting was less than stellar,though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given(or in this case-not)to work with.on top of that is the poor song choices,with really bad lyrics.i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved.they are all talented,but you can't tell from this movie.this is just my opinion of course,but i have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe a 1/10","The movie came across as incredibly uninspiring and felt like a low-budget after school special that was trying too hard to be inspirational. The dialogue was forced and clichéd, the acting was subpar, and the song choices were cringeworthy. Overall, the film lacked excitement and originality, making it a forgettable and disappointing watch."
What changes caused the downfall of the show Dark Angel according to a disappointed viewer?,"What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly ""must see"" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to ""fine-tune"" the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.<br /><br />The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never gets): If it works, don't screw with it!<br /><br />azjazz","The once exciting and original series Dark Angel took a nosedive in quality due to unnecessary changes made by the network. The introduction of new characters in the second season was seen as ridiculous and amateurish, while the new plotlines stretched the show's continuity and credibility too thin. Viewers were disappointed with the unrealistic elements introduced, such as having the main character, Max, who was stated to biologically not need sleep, suddenly shown sleeping and dreaming. The viewer expressed frustration with how the show deviated from what initially attracted fans, emphasizing the importance of not fixing something that wasn't broken."
Do you think the movie uses 'star power' as a marketing strategy?,"Awful, simply awful. It proves my theory about ""star power."" This is supposed to be great TV because the guy who directed (battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick. B O R I N G.<br /><br />Find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your TV with no picture and no sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high b/c there aren't any negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system.)<br /><br />-Zaphoid<br /><br />PS: My theory about ""star power"" is: the more ""star power"" used in a show, the weaker the show is. (It's called an indirect proportionality: quality 1/""star power"", less ""sp"" makes for better quality, etc. Another way to look at it is: ""more is less."")<br /><br />-Z","The movie is simply awful according to a viewer who found it to be boring and lacking in quality. The direction, associated with a well-known director, did not manage to impress and the viewer suggests finding something more interesting to do instead of wasting time watching this movie."
What did you think of the movie after watching it?,"God, I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot. I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just since ""Titanic"", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..). But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ""A-Team"" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her ""gal wit an attitude"" schtick pretty soon. You can count me out of this one, Mr. Cameron!","The movie failed to capture the attention of the audience and lacked a coherent plot, despite having James Cameron's name in the credits. The story felt messy and went nowhere, leaving viewers bored and uninterested throughout its almost two-hour duration. Even although Jessica Alba is beautiful, her one-dimensional facial expression and character portrayal grew tiresome quickly. Overall, this film was a disappointment and fell far below expectations."
What is the overall tone and style of the movie Dark Angel?,"I'm trying to picture the pitch for Dark Angel. ""I'm thinking Matrix, I'm thinking Bladerunner, I'm thinking that chick that plays Faith in Angel, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her, leave that one with us. Only - get this! - we'll do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike. Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes, right?""<br /><br />Flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humourless, desultory, barely competent. Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life. SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it, in fact. :(","Dark Angel is described as flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humorless, and barely competent. It is criticized for lacking plot, dialogue, character development, decent action scenes, and a proper budget. The film is said to be like live action anime without any action or life, catering only to Joe Fanboy's preferences for loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike."
Why did this film fail to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor?,"Im watching it now on pink (Serbia TV station) and I must say this is a crap. Shallow, no acting, effects too sloppy I mean, who made this series?<br /><br />This was a stupid attempt of the Studios to make some more money on the success of the film. OK. The film was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series?<br /><br />Some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write that, was that someones relative at the Studio? This is no SciFi.<br /><br />The film was the bomb, the series suck.","The TV series based on the successful film turned out to be a major disappointment. The lack of depth in the storyline, poor acting, and sloppy effects make it seem like a quick cash grab rather than a well-thought-out production. Viewers can easily spot the unimaginative dialogue and wonder if they hired the writer as a favor rather than for their talent. Compared to the original film, this series is a letdown and fails to capture the essence of the SciFi genre."
What elements of the episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers were found lacking by some viewers?,"The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace, following Johnny Rico leaving his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he lusts for, and joining the mobile infantry. The aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film, instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths.<br /><br />Throughout watching this version, I was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing. The show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits, and the aching, prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors, with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes. In terms of construction, it owes a debt to Top Gun, sharing much in terms of pacing and content (and all that implies).","The slow pace of the show, focus on relationships over action, and the unconventional portrayal of the aliens were underwhelming for some viewers, making it feel disjointed and less exciting compared to the original movie."
Did the movie fail to impress viewers despite having a promising start and an interesting plot setup?,"After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to David Morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night.",The lack of acting skills displayed by Jamie Foxx and the slow progression of the plot were major drawbacks of this movie. Viewers might find themselves wanting to walk away from the screen due to these issues. The film's reliance on David Morse's performance to maintain any level of interest is a clear indicator of its shortcomings. A disappointing choice for a movie night with friends.
Do you think Jamie Foxx's role in this movie reinforced stereotypes rather than breaking new ground?,"Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).<br /><br />Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream. Or In Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.","Jamie Foxx's performance in this film may have elicited some laughs, but it seems like he fell into the trap of portraying a character that perpetuates stereotypes about black males involved in petty crimes. This not only limited his talent but also failed to showcase his potential for more diverse and meaningful roles. It would have been refreshing to see Foxx explore more complex characters, akin to other actors like Marlon Wayans, Tommy Davidson, and Damon Wayans, who have successfully tackled deeper and thought-provoking roles."
What elements of the movie failed to impress the reviewer?,"This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be my last. I failed to see why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying ""I am going to take a shower"".<br /><br />The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. In between, the officials screwing up. The final scenes are utterly unbelievable. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?<br /><br />There's no great acting, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done MTV style. Don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />","The reviewer found the humor lacking in Jamie Foxx's performance and criticized the predictable plot, lack of great acting, storyline, and MTV-style shooting. The final scenes were labeled as utterly unbelievable, lacking in depth, and with officials portrayed as incompetent, leading to a disappointing viewing experience."
Do you think the movie effectively showcases Jamie Foxx's talent and comedic abilities?,"What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny?Does he really believe he is funny?Well, it's funny watching his confidence in being funny.The man has no identity whatsoever...I mean you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies.The only problem is that he does it bad, uneven, and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like Denzel, with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being Martin Lawrence, the funny and clumsy-silly comic. There's no personal touch to all that, I mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. He really is Mr. Dull-boy in person.<br /><br />I was really hoping Hollywood, and the black community in America would find somebody better to launch into super stardom, like Don Cheadle for example, but perhaps the pathetic Jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old.","The reviewer critiqued Jamie Foxx's performance, questioning his comedic skills and originality. They found his imitation of other actors, particularly Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, to be unconvincing and lacking personal touch. The reviewer expressed disappointment in Hollywood's choice to promote Jamie Foxx as a comedic star, suggesting that other actors like Don Cheadle would have been a better fit for the role."
What was your experience as an extra in this film?,"I was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then.Thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set but hey, the pay was good.Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who was going to know.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to shave cost and time.But every one was having such a good time who cared!","The film lacked attention to detail, with scenes being changed during filming to cut corners. The pacing of the race scenes was off, with cars appearing unnaturally sped up. It seemed more like a big party than a professional movie set."
Did the audience find the plot of the film engaging or interesting?,"This is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialog is written in clichés; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron. The ""choreography"" is silly and wholly unerotic. One can only pity the reviewer who saw 23-year-old Yvonne's dance as sexual; it's merely very bad choreography. The ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous. If you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of Hollywood's turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colorized version on VHS, making the movie even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, has her looking like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this film. What a way to launch a career.","This movie is a complete disaster on all levels. The plot is nonsensical, the dialogue is cliché-ridden, the acting is laughably bad, and the choreography is cringeworthy. Even the colorized version on VHS couldn't salvage this trainwreck of a film. The attempts at creating a sexual or erotic atmosphere fall flat, leaving the audience feeling more pity than anything else. It's hard to believe that this film made it past the cutting room floor, let alone received a major Hollywood studio release."
"How does the movie ""The Wooden Horse"" fail to deliver on its potential for excitement and suspense?","This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.<br /><br />I find ""The Wooden Horse"" disappointingly boring. The subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but ""The Wooden Horse"" is told in a very plain way. It's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. The first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. The latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. And could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! I am disappointed by ""The Wooden Horse"", it wasted the potential to be a great film.","Despite the promising premise of British prisoners of war escaping from a camp in Germany during WWII, ""The Wooden Horse"" falls flat in delivering thrills and suspense. The storytelling is plain and poorly executed, lacking in tension and excitement. The events in the film are mundane and fail to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The lack of blunders and close shaves make the first half tedious, and the latter half offers little in terms of a thrilling cat and mouse chase. Additionally, the film's focus on dialogue over action further diminishes its potential for being an engaging action film. Overall, ""The Wooden Horse"" disappoints in its failure to capitalize on the exciting possibilities of its story."
"What are some aspects of the movie ""The Sealed Room"" that might not have resonated well with the audience?","Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; it features a gloriously happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his Queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the King leaves the scene, his Queen makes music with the palace's Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the King discovers the lovers, he decides to enact a horrific Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). The sets make ""The Sealed Room"" look very staged. The performances are okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /><br />*** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard","The storyline of ""The Sealed Room"" appears contrived at times, with unrealistic scenarios like the oblivious lovers failing to detect impending danger. The movie's sets come off as overly theatrical, and the performances, while decent, lack a certain depth. Overall, these elements may detract from the viewer's immersion in the film."
"What is the overall feel of the movie ""The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance""?","(aka: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance)<br /><br />Lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in. The film is supposed to take place in Ireland but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic to me.<br /><br />Gothic lesbians get invited to a Count's island castle for the weekend. One by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around.<br /><br />It's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit. Go figure...(sic)<br /><br />Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity. Directed by euro horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is one snoozer.<br /><br />Pretty boring 2 out of 10","The movie is described as pretty boring with lots of explicit scenes mainly serving as an excuse for nudity. The setting is not convincing, and the horror elements fall short, making it a snoozer with a rating of 2 out of 10."
What elements make THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE a disappointing watch?,"After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I found NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie.<br /><br />The story is simple. A mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation. After some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on Friday.<br /><br />The pace is excruciating. The story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either.<br /><br />Give this one a miss.","THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE fell flat due to the lack of promised bloodsuckers and a disjointed plot that failed to engage viewers. The film's pacing was painfully slow, the story bordered on nonsensical, and even the erotic scenes were lackluster. Overall, this movie is best avoided."
Can you provide more specific details about what makes this movie lack originality and taste?,"This movie is not only a very bad movie, with awful actors --or presumed actors--, a bored direction and a story unattractive, it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent ""giallio"" ""Torso"", directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world. In ""La Sanguinusa conduce la danza"", the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom. Naturally, the scene in Rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in Martino's film. To put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that Rizzo's movie has no ideas, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. I think that such things are an offense to spectator.","This movie is a complete disaster. The actors are terrible, the direction is boring, and the storyline is unappealing. Not to mention, it shamelessly rips off a scene from a much better film, ""Torso."" The lack of originality in copying a scene and failing to capture its essence only highlights the overall lack of creativity and quality in this film. It's a true insult to the audience."
In what way does the movie fail to deliver on its promise of cool looking aliens and a country setting?,"This is a really dumb movie. It could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting, but it just isn't.<br /><br />Some aliens hear the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. The front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space...not really what they do. These aren't party aliens, they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the Jack Nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses. Other than the aliens, the acting is terrible. The writing is obviously meant for children, because every character is written like a kid.<br /><br />This is a dumb movie, that only children will appreciate, maybe.<br /><br />My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild language.","The movie's portrayal of aliens falls short as they come across as stupid and cartoonish, with annoying voices and behavior that contradicts the initial expectation set by the appearance on the cover. Additionally, the acting is subpar and the writing geared towards children, leaving much to be desired for adult viewers."
What makes this movie not worth watching?,"Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result. Violent sexy Milligan at his most home made. Little better than a home movie (as much of Milligans films are) this is a trip into depravity 1960's style. Notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome, playing now more as quaint.(though decidedly r rated). The film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production.(No one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke). Its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a Milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around.","The film suffers from an uneven cast and cheap production quality, making it feel more like a home movie that delves into depravity without effectively delivering either sexiness or gruesomeness. It's a bad movie that may only appeal to die-hard Milligan fans or those interested in watching good-looking people engaging in questionable activities."
"What are some major drawbacks of the film ""Artemisia""?","If you're after the real story of early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you'll be disappointed- however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme, you've found you're movie.<br /><br />This film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of Artemisia Gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep. (Type in Artemisia inaccuracies in Google and check out some of the fact vs. fiction articles.) From a purely technical point of view though, the film was alright: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned GLARING FACTUAL INACCURACIES let it down a bit.<br /><br />I wonder how the director/co-writer Agnès Merlet defended her film at the time? Perhaps she refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would've been unfortunate, because lets face it, she was.","While the film may have impressive sets, costumes, and lighting that immerse you in the early 17th century, the foundational inaccuracies in depicting Artemisia Gentileschi's life are enough to make the viewer weep. The lack of adherence to historical facts significantly undermines the overall quality of the movie, making it a disappointing depiction of the real story. The director's choice to stray from portraying Artemisia as a victim also raises questions about the authenticity of the narrative."
What elements of the artist's life did the movie inaccurately portray and how did it affect the overall impression of the audience?,"As others have noted, this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life and I for one was very annoyed and offended... by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair, by the implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent,' by its complete disregard for her work, by the way it turned her into a sex object, on and on, you get the idea. Also, I find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with Gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her.","The movie completely mishandles the portrayal of the artist's life, especially in the way it transforms a horrifying incident like rape into a romanticized love affair and reduces her to a mere sex object. This inaccurate depiction not only disrespects the artist's work but also misleads the audience about her true identity and achievements."
Was the film based on a true story or entirely fictional?,"An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. It's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.","This film was a complete disaster! The plot was a mess and strayed so far from the real story that it was unrecognizable. The script was bland and lacked any excitement or depth. The rushed ending did little to salvage this trainwreck of a movie. The filmmakers missed a golden opportunity to do justice to the fascinating life of the first famous female Renaissance painter. Instead, they delivered a dull and disappointing result."
Why did the director decide to portray Artemisia's life story so inaccurately and turn it into a romanticized version of reality?,"What did the director think? Everybody who has read the biography of Artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that Tassi was guilty. That fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her MAN. Why do movies depicting Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the Hollywood happy-happy-mood won? While I would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie I cannot make sense of turning Artimisia's life story on its head. Very disappointing choice by the makers of this film.","The movie fails to accurately depict the grit and rawness of Artemisia's life, instead opting for a romanticized and disappointing version of events."
What were your thoughts on the overall impact of the dialogues in the movie?,"When I saw the preview, I thought: this is going to be a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress playing the main character was very credible, and the beauty of the filming is undeniable. However the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610, and it took away most of the magic of the film. However, I must congratulate the translator, because the English sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original French cues, and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd!","The dialogues in the movie were a major disappointment as they felt too modern and out of place for the historical setting of the film. Despite a strong performance from the main actress and visually appealing cinematography, the lack of authenticity in the language used significantly detracted from the overall magic of the storyline. The dialogue did not do justice to the time period in which the movie was set, leaving viewers feeling disconnected from the intended atmosphere of the film."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""Comet Over Broadway""?","I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to take a cut in pay, Warner Bros. retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract.<br /><br />She decided to take the money. But her career suffered accordingly.<br /><br />That might explain what she was doing in ""Comet Over Broadway."" (Though it doesn't explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it, too.) ""Ludicrous"" is the word that others have used for the plot of this film, and that's right on target. The murder trial. Her seedy vaudeville career. Her success in London. Her final scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part.<br /><br />Also, the sets and costumes looked like B-movie stuff. And her hair! Turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month. Watch any OTHER one and you'll be doing yourself a favor.","The plot is considered ludicrous and does not flow logically, with disjointed scenes that lack coherence. The sets and costumes are subpar, resembling low-budget production values. Additionally, Kay Francis's involvement in the film has been called into question, suggesting that watching any other movie of hers would be a better choice."
What makes this movie so disturbing and difficult to watch?,"One of the most disgusting films I have ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800's. What we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered, human birth, branding. Oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn't too bad, but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was OK. The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy. They live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800's. But if you have a choice, do not see this movie.","The movie was very graphic and included scenes of pigs being shot and slaughtered, human birth, branding, and a live calf birth with excessive fluids. Despite an okay story about a widow and her daughter living in the West in the late 1800s, the disturbing visuals make it a movie that most people would prefer to avoid."
What made this movie so unappealing and forgettable according to the review?,"The only thing I remember about this movie are two things: first, as a twelve year old, even I thought it stunk. Second, it was so bad that when Mad magazine did a parody of it, they quit after the first page, and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it.<br /><br />If you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period, try Animal House. It's so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art. Another good selection would be Caddyshack, the classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before he became annoyingly charming, with great lines like greens keeper Carl Spackler's ""Correct me if I'm wrong Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key.""","The movie was deemed terrible even by a twelve-year-old, and it was so horrendous that a parody in Mad magazine was abandoned after the first page. The humor fell flat, making audiences prefer other better options like Animal House or Caddyshack for a good laugh."
What are some reasons this movie might not hold up well for modern audiences after being a childhood favorite?,"I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile. No T&A. No great jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. The only thing that was interesting, to me, was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them. Yep, I watched this movie that much back then! <br /><br />The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say. :(","The movie lacks the humor and entertainment value that once made it enjoyable, with outdated jokes and a lackluster soundtrack, making it disappointing to revisit."
What are some aspects of the movie that make it difficult to watch and disappointing for viewers?,"There are bad movies, terrible movies even boring movies...I can watch most and put up until the end, not this time. Avoid this like the plague, annoying music throughout, terrible editing, no comedy, its tackier than a novelty mug...My missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be Legally Blonde material or something kind of watchable, but never better than average, chick flick. Its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button.<br /><br />The Girls, well, they were not great to start with (Denise done OK in Starship Troopers and Wild things) but you have sank to the gravel. I feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this...Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face.<br /><br />Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen.","The movie is described as unbearable to sit through, with annoying music, terrible editing, and lacking in comedy. The acting of the main characters, particularly Denise Richards and Pamela Anderson, is criticized as disappointing and unconvincing. Viewer warns against wasting time on this film, urging others to avoid it completely."
What did you think of the movie's attempt at humor?,"This movie is not in anyway funny, it tries to be funny with it's lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing, ""when is this gonna end"". One thing you have to hand to them, is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments, which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars. It is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book, even the ones that wasn't funny the first time. It basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this movie is blonde humor gone bad, it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch, it is just that bad.","The movie falls flat in its attempt to be funny, relying on stale and unoriginal blonde jokes that come across as dry and boring. The humor is so cringeworthy that watching the movie feels like torture, with very few mildly funny moments scattered throughout the 2-hour runtime. It's a disappointing display of belittling blonde stereotypes and fails to deliver any genuine entertainment value."
"Would you consider watching a movie that is a rip-off of Dumb and Dumber but less funny, with excessive background noises and music?","Blonde and Blonder was unfunny.Basically, it was a rip-off girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used too much background noises and music.WAY TOO MUCH BACKGROUND NOISES AND MUSIC IF YOU ASK ME!!!!It starts out immensely boring, and TOTALLY inane.It doesn't pick up pace anywhere soon, and I was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on.Maybe, the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes.I found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end, but that was the only part.Also, I couldn't help but like Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard's characters a little.Even though this movie didn't get any laughs from me, it kept my attention.I wouldn't say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than Blonde and Blonder.","Blonde and Blonder failed to deliver genuine humor, starting off as immensely boring and inane. The overuse of background noises and music added to the frustration of the viewing experience. While the last 30 minutes provided some entertainment, it wasn't enough to redeem the overall lackluster nature of the film. Though Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards managed to create somewhat likable characters, the movie ultimately falls short in delivering laughs and fails to stand out among better film choices available."
What made this movie fall flat for the viewers?,"This has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time. Awful acting, awful script... and they were the good points! One to Definitely miss! The jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable as to be pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I sat willing to give it a chance, hoping that it was going to improve which, alas, it didn't! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle down for a good read! I like Denise Richards, which is why I gave this movie a go, but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me!","This movie was a total disaster from start to finish. The acting was terrible, the dialogue was cringeworthy, and the attempts at humor were just sad. Pamela Anderson's reliance on her looks couldn't save the movie from its awful script and direction. Denise Richards' involvement in this mess makes one question her judgment. Overall, a movie to avoid at all costs."
What makes the movie so disappointing?,"Warning: Avoid this super duper awful movie...if you watched it you will be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed.<br /><br />Pam and Denise are grandma age now what are they doing? Trying SO HARD to be young innocent and sexy, just not working AT ALL. Pam and Denise act so horribly in this movie.<br /><br />Plus The script is absolutely atrocious, I can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas. With the development of movie industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century. I bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too.<br /><br />Stay away from it. I think watch ""White Chicks"" from 2004 it's so much better that this...make no mistake at that time I thought that's the worst movie I have ever seen.","The movie is a total disaster, with Pam and Denise giving cringe-worthy performances in their failed attempts to come off as young and sexy. The script is utterly terrible, full of crappy ideas that fail to impress modern movie audiences. It's best to steer clear of this atrocious film and opt for something better like ""White Chicks"" from 2004 instead."
Can you share your thoughts on the movie you recently watched for work?,"I was required to watch the movie for my work, so I didn't pay for it (on the contrary, i got paid), but I still found the movie to suck far more than average. The jokes were lame, the two lead actresses... well, to use the ""First wives club"" division of women's ages in Hollywood, they are no longer in their ""hot chick"" age but more in their ""district attorney"" age. What angered me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized ""Beavis & Butthead Do America"" (in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to ""do his wife"", not realizing they're expected to assassinate her). All in all, a bland piece of crap.",
Would you recommend this film to others?,"I was looking for a cute, simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake.<br /><br />I can't write a single good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs. In my book, that's not funny, that's pathetic.<br /><br />Low budget 'effects' (if I can even call them effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money.<br /><br />Acting... I feel sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this? (looking at their recent filmography, it would appear so.) Despite the outfits, Pamela is showing her age and as a whole, they don't even come across as sexy, let alone funny.<br /><br />This movie is not even in the so-bad-it-is-funny category. It's just bad, as if everybody involved was sick of it.<br /><br />Avoid.","I found this movie to be a huge disappointment. It lacked humor, relying on tired jokes and a farting turtle for laughs. The low budget effects and poor cinematography made it feel like a cheaply made indie film. Even the presence of well-known actors like Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards couldn't save this mess. Overall, I would strongly advise avoiding this movie."
"Do you think this movie is suitable for adults as well as children?

Negative","Sure, I like short cartoons, but I didn't like this one. Naturally, kids would love it. But then again, I'm not a kid anymore (although I still consider myself young).<br /><br />I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason there is no story. How is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an Oscar?! Well... I guess it's because people in the 30's were more happy with not much than now. In the present where we live, everything must happen fast. Look at the movies nowadays, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that doesn't allow men to be slow. That's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 30's, because it seems so peaceful. But every time has got its ups and downs, I guess...<br /><br />To conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you'll have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, don't spill your time on it.","This short cartoon lacks a coherent story, leaving adult viewers feeling unfulfilled. The film's nomination for an Oscar is bewildering, given its lack of substance. The pace of the film may be too slow for modern audiences, making it hard to stay engaged. While kids might enjoy the whimsical music and characters, adults looking for a meaningful storyline will likely find this movie a waste of time."
What elements of the movie were criticized for being offensive and controversial?,"Add to the list of caricatures: a Southern preacher and ""congregation,"" a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), a dancing chorus, and The Mills Brothers -- it only makes it worse.<br /><br />Contemptible burlesques of ""Negro"" performers, who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race. Though the ""Negro comedy"" may have been accepted in its day, it's extremely offensive today, and I doubt that it was ever funny. Though I wouldn't have been offended, I don't think that I'd have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, however, I might not have understood some of it.","The portrayal of ""Negro"" performers in the film was deemed contemptible and offensive, with caricatures of Southern preacher, torch singer, dancing chorus, and The Mills Brothers adding to the negative impact. The attempt at humor was considered feeble and lacking any genuine comedic value, leaving the audience feeling uncomfortable and disappointed."
Is this movie worth recommending to others?,"I watched this movie for a project on love. please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying. My life cannot go on... i accidentally cut off my own hand...my brother was close by. Obviously his fault. And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone. No closure, bad script, and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh. Costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie. It is not a chick flick. It is not a strict romantic. And I can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow. All in all, just not a good flick.","The movie lacks depth in the character portrayal, especially from Nicolas Cage. The script is weak, and the plot doesn't provide closure. It fails to give enough attention to minor characters, making the storyline bland. The movie creates confusion about its genre, not fitting well into intellectual, chick flick, or pure romantic categories. The adult themes make it unsuitable for children. Overall, it falls short of being a good movie and wouldn't be a wise choice for a movie night."
What makes this show difficult to watch and poorly executed?,"This show is painful to watch ...<br /><br />It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show, from the ever changing ""jobs"", boyfriends, and cast. It appears that they wanted to cast Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what, and came up with this crappy show. They cast her as a teen, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy. Soon, they realize that she needs a ""clique"" and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.<br /><br />How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a ""family"" show, and thrown it into it's afternoon lineup on ABC Family.","The show creators seemed lost in their direction, constantly changing character dynamics and putting the lead actress in unfitting adult scenarios. The desperate attempts at comedy fall flat, and the casting of much older actors as teenagers feels forced. It's baffling how this poorly crafted show managed to last for four seasons and be categorized as a ""family"" program."
What makes the characters in this movie poorly written and unappealing?,"What I hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys. Amanda Bynes' talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant on ""All That"" and her own show. Why they would write her and Jenny Garth as vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing, ""old-maid"" wannabes is beyond me.<br /><br />Their plots and dialog remind me of ""The Simpons"", Homer says whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on screen, ""Everyone should ask, where's Poochie?"". All the talk centers on whining about some guy, and then whining to some guy. Sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead. Then they get back together or break up at the end. The 2 women are either shallow, stupid, or sex addicts. The only word I can think of is ""sucks"".","The main issue with this show is the way the female leads are portrayed. They are depicted as lacking self-respect and constantly desperate for male attention, which makes their characters come off as vapid and shallow. Amanda Bynes' talent goes to waste in this movie, as her character is reduced to a one-dimensional, stereotypical portrayal. The repetitive and mundane plot revolve around the women constantly obsessing over guys, with little depth or character development. Overall, the portrayal of the female characters in this movie can be best described as disappointing and unimpressive."
What makes this show unappealing to viewers?<br>,"Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There often quite lame, morale dedicative, and just plain. So is this show! It got a boring cast, although A.Bynes is okej in her perky way, the rest is just stereotypical crap....as always. We have all seen it before, and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled. Cause, lets face it, its a mediocre and self righteous show. As the most sitcoms are....<br /><br />Well, in short. If you wanna see some good entertainment, you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror. Do some faces and move on.... Its more entertaining than this show!","The sitcom is criticized for having a boring cast and relying on stereotypical clichés, making it unoriginal and mediocre. The humor is lacking and the overall entertainment value is deemed low."
What are some major flaws found in the game made by Sega according to a critical review?,"This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I didn't expect much, but I also didn't expect this junk either. For starters the camera angles work against you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the worst part in the game. Whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move. You never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter. The main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You ride through trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy impossible. This game wouldn't even be worth renting.","The game made by Sega falls short in various aspects, including problematic camera angles, unresponsive motorcycle controls, lackluster graphics, and poor combat functionality due to camera issues. The main character's lack of dialogue and inability to fall off the bike further contribute to the overall disappointing experience. The game is deemed unworthy of even a rental, painting a grim picture for potential players."
What are some of the criticisms of this TV series featuring Van Dyke?,"Just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better ""Murder, She Wrote"", it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered its star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, never was much of an actor at all (by his own admission) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. He looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking. His talentless real life son Barry, a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't involve his father, plays his son in the series.","This TV series is described as a stilted rip-off of ""Murder, She Wrote"", poorly-written, unentertaining garbage that somehow lasted for eight years. The lead actor, Van Dyke, is criticized for his age, lack of acting talent, and the casting of his son Barry in a wooden role. The show is said to have only been watched by older audiences with nothing better to do."
"What were your overall thoughts on the movie ""Return to Reality""?","(Spoilers)<br /><br />I was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt.<br /><br />The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole film were two things.<br /><br />First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull.<br /><br />Secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable.<br /><br />Too bad.",
What major flaw does the movie possess that takes away from the overall viewing experience?,"I was lured to see this movie by its starpower, but ultimately that's all it delivers. It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption. It's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and just follow along as they fall like dominoes. The film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex, but has forgotten to substitute good, clean romance or excitement in any other way. All the flavor of a good, flat decaffeinated diet cola. ""Q&A"", which also takes place in New York, is a far better alternative, as is ""LA Confidential"".","The movie lacks suspense and is highly predictable, making it more akin to a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption. It falls flat in terms of delivering excitement or engaging the audience in any meaningful way. Ultimately, it fails to offer any redeeming qualities beyond its starpower."
Was the movie able to live up to the hype and expectations created by the advanced camera technology used in its making?,"i don't know why, but after all the hype on NPR i thought this was a new movie.....all the best footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs...it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day-there are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader.......oops,........... James Earl Jones speak, but I had hoped for a ground breaking movie , considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film......it has been sanitized for a child audience, so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube ....i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is certainly not it","Despite the anticipation surrounding the film due to the innovative camera technology, ""Movie Title"" falls short of delivering a groundbreaking experience. The footage used feels recycled and lacks originality, as it has been previously showcased in nature documentaries. The narration comes off as overly sentimental, and the dramatic music feels forced, aiming to capitalize on the Earth Day theme. While the presence of James Earl Jones adds a touch of nostalgia, the overall film feels tailored to a younger audience, resulting in a diluted viewing experience. Ultimately, the film fails to offer the revolutionary impact expected given the advancements in filmmaking technology."
What elements of the movie made it challenging for skeptics to enjoy it?,"For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.","The movie's use of music, narration, and storylines was critiqued for making it feel more like an animal soap opera rather than a compelling documentary. The melodramatic approach and editing choices, such as cutting away from predator-prey interactions, left some viewers questioning the authenticity of the storytelling and the overall viewing experience."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""The Invisible Man"" directed by Paul Verhoeven?","Leave it to Paul ""sex on the brain"" Verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he'd direct a Pokemon film, I'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts. I don't mind sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) on film but frankly, it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it. It's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon grope women. <br /><br />The game cast of actors does what it can with the one-note cheesy script but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally wasted here.<br /><br />But then what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, btw, is much more entertaining than this stilted & bad film.","The movie is criticized for being pointlessly sleazy and juvenile, with the director focusing more on sex and sleaze rather than exploring the interesting aspects of the invisible man storyline. The film is slammed for featuring an excessive amount of groping scenes by the invisible character, which comes off as distasteful. The talented cast is let down by the cheesy script, leaving some actors like William Devane feeling wasted in their roles. Overall, the film is considered stilted and bad, failing to live up to the expectations set by the director's previous works."
What impact does the portrayal of the lead character have on the overall viewer experience?,"I love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I have seen most of this movie, since it's been airing on HBO for the past couple of months. I must admit, I MAY have missed a few scenes, but I'm usually drawn into movies, and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see some of ""Hollow Man,"" I feel depressed, almost like a ""film noir."" I'm not sure why; perhaps it's that I don't want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and there's disappointment in that. But I think it's witnessing just HOW relentlessly evil he becomes. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps 12, if they are mature).","The movie ""Hollow Man"" fails to deliver a cohesive storyline despite its impressive special effects. The plot feels disjointed and the pacing is sluggish, making it hard to stay engaged throughout. The protagonist's descent into evil lacks depth and comes off as one-dimensional, leaving viewers feeling disconnected and unfulfilled. Additionally, the film's dark and sinister tone may not be suitable for younger audiences, making it a questionable choice for family viewing."
What are some aspects of this movie that viewers may find lacking?,"This movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects. There are some interesting visuals.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance. True to the title.<br /><br />It's not worth picking apart the story. That's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There's not much there to begin with. It's nothing original and not very special. So don't go in for the story at all. Just look at the effects.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, it got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great FX treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man. However if you ignore the ""standard"" pyrotechnics, it's a sight to behold (or not to behold).<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent FX film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone.","Despite the impressive special effects, this film falls short in terms of its storyline and overall substance. The narrative is weak and lacking originality, making it difficult for viewers to become truly invested in the movie. While the visual effects may be a highlight, the flashy ending detracts from the overall experience, leaving little to appreciate besides the dazzling effects. It's a film that prioritizes style over substance, making it hard to fully engage with."
What movie features an actress like Elizabeth Shue and a character with perverse tendencies played by Kevin Bacon?,"Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? I must give credit where credit is due, though. Some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, that has any form of self-respect to account for.","The movie was overall disappointing with its unimpressive plot and questionable character choices. The performances felt lackluster, making one wonder why talented actors like Elizabeth Shue would even be involved in such a lackluster project. Additionally, the unsettling nature of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine, made it hard to find any redeeming qualities in the storyline. In short, this movie is best avoided by those value their time and entertainment choices."
What are some shortcomings of the film The Hollow Man?,"Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, Bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves. The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.","The movie suffers from a lack of depth in terms of story, dialogue, and performance. Despite visually striking scenes, the film falls short by neglecting these essential elements. Kevin Bacon's portrayal of a corrupt scientist is not compelling enough, and the performances by Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin fail to leave a lasting impact. The climax of the film is over-the-top and requires a significant suspension of disbelief."
"What are some of the major drawbacks of the film 'Hollow Man'?,","To describe this film as garbage is unfair. At least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby. This flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon can act superbly given the chance, so no doubt had an IRS bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay. The mad scientist story of 'Hollow Man' has been told before, been told better, and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects.<br /><br />Most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK they were marketed as 'The Transparent Man (/Woman/Dog)' which is maybe where they got the title for this film.<br /><br />Clever special effects, dire script, non-existent plot.<br /><br />","The reviewer describes 'Hollow Man' as a film that fails to captivate and entertains the audience. Despite a talented actor like Kevin Bacon in the lead role, the screenplay is deemed subpar. The special effects are criticized for being outdated and unimpressive, drawing attention away from the already feeble plot. Overall, the movie is labeled as a disappointment due to its lackluster execution and unoriginal story."
What were the shortcomings of the movie regarding the plot and execution?,"This picture started out with good intentions, Bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is cute as usual in her role. It all falls apart after that, it's your typical Hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humour, wit or soul. In other words, don't waste your time watching this. Get the audiocassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man instead, also starring Leonard Nimoy. Now that was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike with this mess.","The movie started off with a promising premise of a scientist testing invisibility, accompanied by the charming performance of the lead actress. However, as the story progressed, it devolved into a stereotypical Hollywood thriller with excessive reliance on special effects. The film lacked both humor and depth, making it a forgettable and uninteresting watch. It failed to capture the essence and spirit of the original story, in contrast to more successful adaptations."
"What has led to the downfall of the show ""The Apprentice"" in the eyes of this reviewer?","I LOVED the Apprentice for the first two seasons.<br /><br />But now with season 5? (or is it 6?) things are getting just plain too tiring.<br /><br />I used to like the show, but its become Donald Trumps own ego fest. Granted its his company you'll be working for, but come on! some of the things says ""You're FIRED"" is just insulting.<br /><br />after watching the show, I would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or such. Its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm. Good Entertainment? YES, but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring.. its not team work, its not personal, its just business. watch your back jack.","The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the transition of ""The Apprentice"" over the seasons, particularly season 5 (or maybe 6?). They feel that the show has shifted from being enjoyable to becoming more of a platform for Donald Trump's ego. The reviewer finds the way Trump fires people on the show to be insulting and the cutthroat nature of the show to be tiring. They believe that the show lacks teamwork and personal connections, focusing solely on business and backstabbing. Ultimately, the reviewer states that after watching the show, they would not want to work for Trump, not because of his personality, but due to the unrealistic and discomforting portrayal on the show."
Was the storyline too contrived with the involvement of Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore in the movie?,"I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't just too contrived for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was that ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" double episode crap? All that cliché mafia banter- COME ON! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... This is not reality but staged drama! Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor"" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br />Yuk!","The movie felt staged and contrived with cliché mafia banter, questionable exits of big names, and scripted drama that left the viewer feeling disappointed and disconnected from reality. The involvement of Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore seemed pre-negotiated, making it difficult to believe in the authenticity of the plot."
What are some of the reasons for the negative review?,"I can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with Paris Hilton, and sure it's his company. But ""you're fired"" or ""you're hired"", for how many seasons now? After watching the show I wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.<br /><br />I'd love to hear just one person get up and say ""Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo"". I see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I'd give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that.","The reviewer found the show to be worse than most reality shows, criticizing the repetitive nature of the ""you're fired"" or ""you're hired"" catchphrase. They also disapproved of the main personality's ego and expressed a strong dislike towards the individual. The reviewer even made derogatory comments about the person's appearance and expressed a desire for them to get hurt. Overall, they felt the show lacked entertainment value and rated it a 1 out of 10."
Was the production of this film questionable?,"One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a<br /><br />script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But<br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is<br /><br />non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to<br /><br />put it politely) amateurish. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate<br /><br />choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone<br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this film.","The storytelling lacks coherence and editing seems amateurish. Characters lack depth and the overall execution comes across as disjointed. The title, ""Not One Sleeps,"" might be fitting as viewers may struggle to stay awake during this confusing mess."
"What is one positive aspect of the film ""The Good Earth"" according to the review provided?

Negative","The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is borderline comical. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice. The only saving grace I found with this film is it's production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time. Other than the production value I can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film.","This movie is just painfully boring to sit through. The plot drags on, the acting is cringe-worthy, and even Paul Muni couldn't save it. The only thing worth mentioning is the production value with the use of extras and special effects, but that's hardly enough to make up for the lackluster storyline and performances. Save yourself the time and skip this one."
"What makes ""The Good Earth"" an unappealing movie to watch?","The Good Earth is not a great film by any means, it is way to ordinary. Maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer. It is not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long. I could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act. In short Wang Lung (Muni) a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him. Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds. The film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next. Also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments, it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis.","""The Good Earth"" is too ordinary and uninteresting, focusing on the life of a farmer which fails to captivate the audience. Despite the strong performances by the actors, the film feels dragged out and predictable, with a lack of engaging characters or light-hearted moments, making it a rather depressing watch about the struggles of a farmer during crisis."
What impact did the lack of development in Luise Rainer's character have on the overall viewing experience of The Good Earth?,"Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.","Despite Luise Rainer receiving an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth, her character lacked depth and emotion, making her portrayal feel lackluster and unconvincing. Throughout the film, Rainer's character remained stagnant and failed to exhibit any significant emotional range, causing her performance to fall flat. This lack of development in her character made it difficult for audiences to connect with her role, ultimately detracting from the overall viewing experience."
How does the casting choices in The Good Earth affect the overall authenticity of the movie?,"The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent, as do most of the lead actors, that I could not bear listening to him speak.<br /><br />It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans.","The Good Earth has a strong and compelling storyline, but the decision to cast Anglos in lead roles, who struggle to accurately portray Chinese characters due to their heavy American accents, significantly detracts from the movie's authenticity and can be seen as a perpetuation of racist beliefs. Hollywood missed an opportunity to cast Asians in the lead roles, resulting in a lack of genuine representation and immersion for the audience."
Can you identify any redeeming qualities of the movie despite its flaws?,"Well, what was fun... except for the fun part.<br /><br />It's my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'.<br /><br />Let's start with the good. The teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover that I am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.<br /><br />But then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. Little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful. There were about one or two quotable lines. <br /><br />and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me. In the end... what's the point? they all pretty much died. We didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and I couldn't even find Sophia's death sad... just very frustrating.<br /><br />* star. shame because Season 2 was doing so well.","The movie had some redeeming qualities such as the well-done teaser and emotional connection with the animals, but overall, the film lacked coherence, had poor dialogue, and was unpleasant due to the deaths of many animals. The plot involving aliens and impregnation was also hard to follow, making it frustrating and unentertaining."
What makes this movie stand out among other horror films?,"I desperately want to give this movie a 10...I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies are so budget that they are good. A wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry...definitely fits this 'budget to brilliance' system. The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy...ninja... puberty-stricken... pre-thirty year old student...non-cowboy drawing...wise-cracking...son-of-a-bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year. All I can really say is, 'can you dig it' and recommend watching movies such as Frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror.<br /><br />(WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY SMOKING!?'","This movie is so ridiculous and absurd that it's hard to take it seriously. The storyline is all over the place, the acting is subpar, and the attempt at humor falls flat. The character of the ninja scarecrow feels forced and lacks any real scare factor. It seems like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be unique and ended up with a messy, incoherent mess of a movie. Additionally, the supposed twists and turns come off as predictable rather than suspenseful. Overall, this film is better off avoided if you're looking for a genuinely good horror flick."
What is your overall opinion on this movie?,"Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.","This movie is a complete disaster. From the nonsensical plot to the excessive gore and distasteful sex scenes, it's a cringe-worthy mess. The director's attempt at being shocking falls flat, and the majority of the actors deliver forgettable performances. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this abomination."
Was the main character portrayed convincingly in the movie?,"This movie is so aggrivating. The main character looks like he's 35 and I've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy. The plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor.<br /><br />Also some of the worst dialogue I've heard in 3 years, ""lets go find a small animal to torture"".<br /><br />Ugh.....I can't even continue, don't watch this pile of garbage, it was made in 8 days.<br /><br />The one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures.<br /><br />2 out of 10, unwatchable","This movie is truly disappointing. The main character appears unconvincing, lacking the courage and charisma expected. The plot twists are overly familiar, offering no element of surprise or engagement. The dialogue is cringeworthy, with lines that fail to resonate with the audience. The overall quality of the movie feels rushed, almost as if it was hastily put together without attention to detail. It's a film that ultimately falls flat and should be avoided."
Would you recommend this movie to others?,"WOW is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it. trust me watch it!<br /><br />i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny! I cant believe they superimposed the school sign! I must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time. If a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies. even the costume was bad. it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it. heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well. all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first. its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done. hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out, just not like this one.","The acting in this movie was terrible, to the point where it was unintentionally funny. The special effects, like the superimposed school sign, were so poorly executed that it became a source of amusement rather than fear. Even the costume design looked like it was put together by a child. It's hard to believe that such a poorly made movie was even released. If you're looking for a good scarecrow horror movie, this definitely isn't it."
What are some flaws that can be found in the movie?,"First off, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: ""This entire movie had to have been a dare. You know, like, 'DUDE, I BET YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE WORST MOVIE EVER'"". With this movie, they've made a good effort at achieving that title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. The actors, I'm assuming, are supposed to be in college. Yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school. It makes no sense. The Scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable. (SPOILER: At the end, when they chant Lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and Scarecrow are both laughing, probably out of relief they were on their last scene, and at the cheesy dialogue.)","The movie seems to lack quality in various aspects. The special effects appear poorly executed, the plot and dialogue feel unoriginal and borrowed from other horror movies, and the age portrayal of the characters is inconsistent and confusing. The antagonist's actions aren't engaging, and even in a critical scene, the laughter of characters seems more like relief from finishing the scene than genuine emotion. These quality issues make the movie unenjoyable for viewers."
What aspects of the movie particularly disappointed you when you were watching it?,I'm watching this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so horrible I can't stop watching it! I'm a Videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. Some of the camera work is good. Most is very questionable. There are a few decent actors in the flick. Too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives. That's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! Music was a little better than the acting. If you get around to watching this I hope it's because there was absolutely NO other option! The sequel (yes sequel) is coming on now....I think I'll skip it! Jason,I'm watching this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so horrible I can't stop watching it!

What makes this film a lousy piece of crap according to the reviewer?,"Wow, what can I say about this film? It's a lousy piece of crap. I'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did. What's wrong with this film? Here's a better question: What's NOT wrong with this film.<br /><br />The story itself is just crap and cliché. Here's pretty much what it's about...Some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on, gets killed, and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge. ""All"" of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film. If you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it. Also, the second one isn't much better, so don't bother watching that either...I rated this movie a three because I liked the scarecrow's outfit, not because there was anything good about the movie. I think you get the picture.","The reviewer goes on to describe the film as having a terrible and cliché storyline, with a nerdy kid getting picked on, killed, and coming back as a scarecrow for revenge in just 86 minutes of worthless content. They advise against wasting time watching this movie, even warning against its sequel. The only positive remark was about the scarecrow's outfit, not the movie itself."
Would you recommend watching SCARECROW based on this review?,"A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.","SCARECROW is described as a cringeworthy B-movie that borders on being unbearable to watch. The storyline is criticized for being absurd and unoriginal, with a mix of inappropriate and disturbing scenes. The character development is lackluster and the scarecrow's abilities are seen as unrealistic and unconvincing. Overall, this film is considered a forgettable and regrettable viewing experience."
What sets this movie apart from other action films you've seen before?,"Okay, 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term, but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of James Glickenhaus' calibre.<br /><br />McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous, over the top action films I've ever seen, without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos, but how about making a film in the Philippines that is set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact the only character who looks remotely Hispanic is good ol' Victor Argo as the much reviled 'El Presidente'! Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of American imperialism.","While some may find the over-the-top nature of 'McBain' entertaining, the nonsensical setting and lack of authenticity in portraying Colombian characters could make it difficult for viewers to fully immerse themselves in the story. The exaggerated performances and unrealistic scenarios may also come across as more comical than thrilling, ultimately detracting from the overall viewing experience."
What are some of the main reasons why this movie failed to impress audiences?,"This was an absolutely terrible movie. Don't be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.","This film failed to deliver a compelling storyline, with ridiculous and unconvincing scenes involving the actors, particularly Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside. The attempt at showcasing US propaganda fell flat and the performances felt forced, especially Maria Conchita Alonso's portrayal which felt superficial and unengaging. Overall, the movie lacked substance and failed to capture the audience's attention, leaving viewers disappointed."
Can you explain why the interesting plot lines are left unexplained or ignored in this movie?,"The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' several times. Yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored, like they never happened. The lead character was irritating throughout the movie, and at one point my fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some genuinely spooky/scary moments, but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me. It's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser.","The movie had potential with some spooky and scary moments, but ultimately fell short due to an irritating lead character and unresolved plot lines that left viewers frustrated and confused. The antagonist was more likable than the lead, making the overall viewing experience disappointing and ineffective."
Did the film fail to engage the audience with its lead character and overall scare factor?,"Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money. Just how commercial did this film prove. The Film Council ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the London Undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clichéd, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably Deathline. Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute. It's a little bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, at the UK Film Council, could have noticed this at the script stage. Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare.","This movie was a complete disappointment funded by the UK Lottery money. It was overly commercial, clichéd, and felt like a mishmash of various horror movies without any originality. The lead character lacked sympathy until the very end, which was too little, too late. The terrible acting and laughable appearance of the creature further contributed to its failure in delivering any real scares."
What were your frustrations with the main character in the movie?,"......in a horror movie that is. Alright first off , lets start with Kate. Her main goals include getting laid by George Clooney, looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over. Gotta love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but ..... instead she ran. I mean she didn't wanna bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late. I mean the guy tried to rape her. I cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night. The movie kept going on. And as a result lost all its credibility.","The main character, Kate, displayed frustrating decisions throughout the film by constantly running away from dangerous situations instead of taking action. This lack of agency created a disconnect with the audience and made it hard to root for her. Additionally, her actions led to the loss of credibility in the storyline, leaving viewers disappointed in the character development."
Was Creep a memorable film for the viewer?,"I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed. I didn't feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.<br /><br />I walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. Haven't we seen this all before? I didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But then again I couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? So many questions need to be answered.<br /><br />Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely.<br /><br />Not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.","The movie Creep failed to impress the audience, leaving them feeling uninvolved and uninterested. The excessive gore was deemed disturbing, making some viewers feel sick. The lack of originality in the storyline led to boredom, with viewers hoping for something more engaging to happen. The characters were unlikable for the most part, except for one, but his survival without proper explanation left viewers puzzled. Overall, Creep fell short of being a standout film, with viewers feeling indifferent towards it."
What are some of the main issues with this British horror film set in the London underground?,"All logic goes straight out of the train window in this British horror film, set in the London underground and starring the usually reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), Franka plays Kate, a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station, only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by ""someone"" or ""something"" with killer intentions.<br /><br />Plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull.<br /><br />All in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour.<br /><br />The only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who's done better than this  that's even including ""Erasmus Microman""!.","The movie lacks logical consistency and is full of plot holes and unbelievable moments. It fails to deliver genuine scares, with many dull moments throughout. Overall, it is considered an unpleasant film that should remain buried underground and not see the light of day. The only redeeming aspect is the presence of veteran actor Ken Campbell in the cast."
What are some reasons why this film didn't meet the expectations of some viewers?,"I was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't able to excite, really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that didn't redeem it. I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director/writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate's part, it may have worked - Jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it. Such a shame. Disappointing.","Many viewers were disappointed with this film as they found the storyline to be unconvincing, lacking strong characters, and failing to deliver a compelling horror experience. The abundance of unnecessary characters, particularly Jeremy Sheffield's performance, was criticized for being wooden and contributing negatively to the overall viewing experience. The potential for the film to excel was present with the interesting premise, but ultimately fell short in generating excitement, scares, or shocks."
Would you recommend this film to someone who is squeamish about bodily functions?,"This film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill ""wonder of the human body"" documentaries by bravely, if bizarrely, opting to elicit disgust in the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it. In another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo. In a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of...teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I'm not making any of this up. See this film if you must, but: bring your vomit bag, and don't have pasta salad beforehand.","This film crosses the line from informative to downright repulsive, with scenes that are more likely to induce nausea than awe. The excessive focus on disgusting bodily functions may turn off many viewers, and some scenes may even be too much to stomach for those with a weak constitution."
Why was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel of Man From Snowy River?,"After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It just wasn't the same without Spur and Harrison, as portrayed by Douglas. Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was--Jim returns after extended absence, to find Jessica being pursued by another man. He could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him, and not find competition. For a Disney movie, this contains foul language, plus the highly unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica shacked up without being married--very LAME. Quite an insult to viewer intelligence, according to members of my family. I'll stick with the first one, and try to forget I ever saw the sequel!",The sequel of Man From Snowy River lacked the charm of the original due to the absence of Kirk Douglas in his dual roles. The plot felt weak with Jim's sudden return and the unnecessary portrayal of Jim and Jessica shacking up without being married. The inclusion of foul language and lack of character development made it an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Stick with the first movie and forget about the disappointing sequel.
What elements of the sequel to Man From Snowy River left viewers disappointed?,"The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, nearly perfect. A Lady and the Tramp storyline in two senses--rich girl/poor boy, and ability vs. bloodline. The sequel, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous, overblown Disneyfied mess best summarized as ""Rambo Meets the Black Stallion."" Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence, and suddenly he's Superman on horseback; in the original, good film, he was real and believable, but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I've hardly been as disappointed in a movie, and at times this thing made me quite angry--they missed hardly a cliché. Brazen audience manipulation--do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them, to make them happy? A mess of a movie.","The sequel to the original movie disappointingly falls short of expectations, deviating from the charm and authenticity of its predecessor. Instead of staying true to the realistic and relatable portrayal of the young hero, the sequel presents him as a superhuman caricature, resulting in a lack of believability. The attempt to cash in on the success of the original film only leads to a Disneyfied mess that feels like a forced blend of Rambo and The Black Stallion, with an abundance of clichés and blatant audience manipulation. Ultimately, this sequel fails to capture the essence that made the original movie so beloved and leaves viewers feeling frustrated and let down."
"What are some drawbacks of the film ""The Man From Snowy River 2""?","This film, like the first one (""The Man From Snowy River"") has the same good and bad features, perhaps even more so than the original. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. <br /><br />The GOOD - Magnificent scenery, better than the first film. I love those high country shots in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a likable guy, as ""Jim Craig."" Bruce Rowland did a nice job with the music, too.<br /><br />The BAD - Once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine ""Jessica"" (Sigrid Thornton) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. In this film, we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father. Previously it was Kirk Douglas, now replaced by the always -profane Brian Dennehy. Speaking of that, it is a disgrace that a Walt Disney film would includes usages of the Lord's name in vain. That was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s. This film, like the first one","The film's downfall lies in the portrayal of the feminist heroine ""Jessica"" as obnoxious and annoying, overshadowing the good aspects of magnificent scenery and likable characters. Additionally, the replacement of actors and the inclusion of profane language, especially the disrespectful use of the Lord's name, detract from the overall viewing experience."
What negative aspects did critics point out about the movie adaptation of the book?,"Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today.<br /><br />As for the movie... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and CIRCLING around everything, making the viewer quite nauseous. Why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond me--but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book.","The movie's excessive use of circular camerawork made viewers feel queasy, and the performances from the actors, though typically strong, felt out of place due to poor casting decisions. Overall, the adaptation was considered weak compared to the source material."
Why did the reviewer find the movie boring with not enough blood for a horror film?,"This movie isn't very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror film. The plot just trods along with not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. But, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.",
What are some of the major flaws in this vampire movie?,"The last reviewer was very generous. I quiet like the first movie, but can't say I enjoy this one very much. The beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill pretty quickly. I just don't see Jon Bon Jovi as a ""bad-ass vampire hunter"" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. A lot of the scenes just do not make sense. I mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why Una is able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was ever explain in this movie, you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining, but that was too much to ask. This has to be one of worst vampire movie I have seen.","The second movie is a major disappointment compared to the first one. The storyline lacks coherence, the characters are unconvincing, and the action scenes fall flat. Jon Bon Jovi fails to pull off the role of a tough vampire hunter, and the vampire princess lacks both allure and fright. Too many scenes lack logic, making it difficult to suspend disbelief. There are gaping plot holes that are never addressed, leaving the audience bewildered. Overall, this film falls short in providing entertainment and fails as a vampire movie."
What were the biggest letdowns in John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos?,"I only rented this because i loved the first movie. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it. He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?)<br /><br />A tragic storyline, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time. It's not even comically bad.<br /><br />What we end up with is a dull, uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichéd acting. It just reeks of low budget.<br /><br />Avoid like the Bubonic plague.","I only rented this because I loved the first movie, but this one turned out to be a disappointment. The fact that it's titled John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos as a marketing ploy to trick viewers is frustrating. The movie lacks a compelling storyline, has poor special effects, and Jon Bon Jovi's portrayal as a Vampire Hunter falls flat. The film is not even enjoyable in a cheesy way. The overall film feels dull and uninteresting, with a weak script and subpar acting. It's evident that it has a low budget feel. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie entirely."
What are some major flaws in the movie?,"This movie is one of the most awful movies ever made.How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer not an actor, What?Is he killing vampires with his guitar? And what about the dreadful plot? O my God this movie really sucks. In the end is the Queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the ""fantastic"" slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left!! What happened with the other 10-15 vampires? They run out in the sun??? And what about the ""Grand Finally"" when Bon Jovi blows her head with a shotgun??? That's really a ""NOT"" . In ""Buffy the vampire Slayer"" in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN??? This really is a lack of originality!","This movie is a total disaster, with Jon Bon Jovi's lackluster acting skills standing out like a sore thumb. The plot is so absurd and poorly executed that it's almost laughable. The inconsistency with the number of vampires in the final scene is just one of many incoherent aspects. The climax involving Bon Jovi using a shotgun to kill the Queen of vampires is ridiculously unoriginal, especially when compared to a show like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" which managed to avoid such cliches over 100 episodes. Overall, this film is a prime example of a cheesy, poorly conceived vampire movie that falls flat on every level."
What are some of the major casting issues in the movie?,"The producers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester, who couldn't act or sing, in the title role. Aside from his very bad ""acting"", all of Lester's singing had to be dubbed by a girl. I don't know why they cast him at all, since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well. Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy, who was only supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was. It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.","The producers made a big mistake by casting Mark Lester in the title role as he couldn't act or sing, and had to be dubbed by a girl. Shani Wallis was also criticized for being too old to play Nancy. Ross McCormack was praised as the best Artful Dodger, but the movie was heavily criticized for its casting choices."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""Oliver!"" as mentioned in the review?","I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one. **MILD SPOILERS** Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse? The poor of London coming out to sing? Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison. **END OF SPOILERS**<br /><br />Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than growling to indicate his evil. Worst however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he's really the main character. His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl. Guess they didn't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in England.<br /><br />Self-respecting Dickens fans: stick to David Lean's amazing 1948 film or the BBC 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80's. Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical.","The reviewer criticized the film for deviating from the original novel by Charles Dickens, specifically pointing out inconsistencies in characters' fates and behavior. They also harshly criticized Oliver Reed's performance as Sykes, labeling it as weak, and Mark Lester's portrayal of Oliver as awkward and passive. The reviewer even mocked the dubbing of a girl's voice for Lester's singing, highlighting the lack of authenticity in the casting. Ultimately, the review advised Dickens fans to avoid this musical adaptation in favor of other film versions that stay truer to the source material."
"What are some drawbacks of the film ""Basic Instinct 2""?","This film is awful. The screenplay is bad, the is script mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la ""War of the Worlds""), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.","The movie's screenplay and script are poorly executed, the sex scenes lack impact, and the overall thrill and intrigue of the original film are missing. The dark, monochromatic style of the film is disappointing compared to the beauty of the original. The main character's lack of facial expressions makes the performance dull, and the plot twists are lacking and feel anticlimactic. Despite Sharon Stone's strong performance, it's not enough to salvage the film overall."
What were your thoughts on the ending of the movie?,"After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, ""journey is more important than the destination"". Unbelievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to the normal life.<br /><br />Worst ending ever.","The ending of the movie was a huge disappointment. It felt like a betrayal after investing so much time in the series. The final episode completely disregarded the essence of the previous storyline, leaving many loose ends and unanswered questions. Captain Janeway's actions seemed out of character, and the resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying. The decision to focus on saving only one character felt unfair to the rest of the crew who sacrificed so much throughout the journey. Overall, the ending was illogical and left viewers feeling let down."
Can you recommend any other movies from the AFI's list of the top 100 comedies that would offer more laughs than this one?,"I've been going through the AFI's list of the top 100 comedies, and I must say that this is truly one of the worst. Not just of the 90 movies on the list I've seen, but of any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are funny sometimes, Dudley isn't. Liza almost made it worthwhile, but alas... just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny? I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the AFI's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see a funnier ""drunk"", try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).","I've been going through the AFI's list of the top 100 comedies, and I must say that this is truly one of the worst.

"What makes ""Waqt: Race Against Time"" a movie to avoid watching?","This movie's full title is ""Waqt: Race Against Time"". That's a race no one can ever win, but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious ""waqt"" on this bakvaas. This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. It strained my credulity too far. It was ridiculously stupid in its storyline, and deserves to be mocked for it.<br /><br />It's not quite as awful as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it. Stupid, pointless, with a ridiculously OTT performance by Amitji. The central ""plot"" is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many ""family"" BW films. If my father, who raised me, and who I love dearly, treated me like Big B did Akshay, I'd shoot him myself. To say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness.","This movie was a total waste of time and was filled with a ridiculous storyline that strained believability. The performances were over the top, especially Amitabh Bachchan's. The film's central plot was manipulative and propagated harmful messages about family relationships. It is a movie that has nothing redeeming about it and should be avoided at all costs."
Can you believe what a disappointment this movie turned out to be?,"Those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good parent does...kick his son out the son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow- 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man, gets bitten by rabified dogs, to then just walk off. This film is an INSulT to our intelligence I really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'.","This movie was an insult to intelligence, with a plot so unrealistic that it made a Walt Disney production seem more believable. The characters' abrupt transitions from luxury to poverty and the sudden miraculous job changes for no apparent reason made it an incredibly frustrating experience to watch. The financial contribution to this film was regretted as we left the cinema with disappointment rather than satisfaction. Save yourself the time and avoid subjecting yourself to this mess."
What were your thoughts on the overall acting in the movie?,"this is just usual Indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema, as Indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry, however it also the worst.<br /><br />how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage. take a look at Russia, Iran, china and Latin America, look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like Kisna!!<br /><br />get real people, no wonder the international community in general laughs at Indian cinema.","The acting in this film was wooden, and the lack of emotional depth from the actors made it hard to connect with the characters. It felt like the performances were phoned in, and there was a clear lack of chemistry between the cast members."
Did the star-studded cast give justice to the movie?,"well well One cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast ..i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who? race against time? u mean waste against time? OK so first you spoil your kid,then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it Hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway!","The movie fails to impress with its superficial humor, forgettable songs, and forced storyline. The attempt at a unique concept comes off as a waste of time, overshadowing the potential for a meaningful message. It feels like a missed opportunity, as the talent on screen seems wasted in this lackluster production."
Do you think the movie Waqt - a race against time successfully incorporates elements from Gujarati Theatre into Bollywood?,"First of all there is Gujarati Theatre then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fan following. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theatre when making a Bollywood production. First he made Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play) - which had a unique plot, but could not hold as a Hindi film. Now he's adapted another Gujarati play and named it Waqt - a race against time. In sum, the emotions are alien. The plot development is not for Hindi films. For example, the role play between father and son is best left to Gujarati Theatre - don't bring it in a Hindi film. Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - nothing to shout about - barring Shefali Chhaya Shah who is fantastic.","The film failed to effectively transition Gujarati Theatre elements into a Bollywood production. The emotions and plot development felt out of place for Hindi cinema, with role-play between father and son and comedic elements better suited for the Gujarati stage. Performances were average, lacking standout moments aside from Shefali Chhaya Shah's fantastic portrayal."
Who was miscast in the movie and what impact did it have on the overall film?,"I found this film to be quite an oddity. From the very get go I found it extremely hard to like this movie, and now after a little thinking about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to bits (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here, and although I can't figure for the life of me who would be better, I am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work. Everything else is fine, except for the stabs at weak comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) and I really like Richard E. Grant as the British Major. It just suffers from one thing.. Jean-Marc.","The film suffers from a miscast Jean-Marc Barr, which detrimentally affected the movie's appeal. Despite some redeeming qualities such as Richard E. Grant's performance, the attempts at weak comedy and Barr's lackluster portrayal hindered the overall experience."
Did the acting talent go to waste in this movie?,"Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, both thinking, this has to get better, these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap. Unattractive characters, hackneyed script, and listless pacing make for a long two hours. I actually couldn't hack it and left to do the grocery shopping (cat litter being more appealing than this film). The husband stayed and confirmed that it didn't get better--by the time Buddy is killed, you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful scenery and costumes can't keep this one alive.","The movie was a disappointment because of unattractive characters, a worn-out script, and slow pacing. It was so bad that one person left to do grocery shopping, finding cat litter more appealing than the film. The husband who stayed confirmed that it didn't improve, leading to a desire for the characters to meet a tragic end. Despite beautiful scenery and costumes, the movie failed to deliver."
What are some reasons behind the disappointment with the film?,"This crap is like watching paint dry. I'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it.<br /><br />There simply is no meaning to this film. If it were never made, no one would notice or care. It's hyped up because of all the big names in it, but if ""nobody's"" were in, nobody would give this film any love.<br /><br />Seriously, I was at the point where half-way through the film I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, ""Hurry up and die already!"" This is like the ""Joy Luck Club"" without any of the friggin' joy. It's the ""Ocean's 13"" (nothing but a big-named cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic...oh until it's finally over.<br /><br />I'm sure they'll all be nominated for Oscars...<br /><br />- 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk.","The film was compared to watching paint dry, lacking any significant meaning or value. The presence of well-known actors was highlighted as the only reason for its hype, as the story was deemed uninteresting and anti-climactic. The reviewer expressed impatience for the film to end, akin to wanting a character to hurry up and die."
What were some of the shortcomings of the movie?,"Just PPV'd this. I don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could, but I did want to say a few things.<br /><br />I didn't know which was funnier: Redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse; Close wailing that her ""precious"" boy (whom she and the Mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has been turned into roadkill; that the tone-deaf Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or the horrid CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie gazing at her younger self!<br /><br />I never bought Danes as the younger Redgrave. I didn't buy Richardson and Collette as sisters, either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, she better get Mama to give her a few lessons! I had zero idea why any girl (or Buddy) would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she, Luc is a retarded slacker on crack, and I didn't give a rot about any of them! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name!","The casting choices were questionable, with actors not convincingly portraying their roles. The CGI effects were poorly done, and the characters were unlikable and lacked depth, making it difficult for the audience to care about their stories. The movie ultimately failed to make a positive impact and contributed to giving Chick Flicks a bad reputation."
What were the main disappointments in the movie?,"I saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening, and I must say I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about Danes, she was either horribly miscast, or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her. Instead, she is completely unlikeable. The other ""great"" actresses do an OK job, but certainly don't light up the screen. Out of all the ""great"" actresses in this movie, I'd say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture, and only appears near the very end.<br /><br />Horrible screenplay as well. It comes off more as them reading lines than truly being ""in character.""","The lead actress, Claire Danes, was miscast and came off completely unlikeable, making it hard to sympathize with her character. The other actresses also failed to light up the screen, with even great talents like Meryl Streep barely appearing and the screenplay feeling more like lines being read than true character portrayal."
What did the reviewer find disappointing about the movie Evening?,"I never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel (especially a beloved one, like Evening) but when I saw that the book's author, Susan Minot, was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film, I thought that Evening would be a good adaptation.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the book, don't bother with this movie. It is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.<br /><br />Here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the son of the housekeeper. Buddy is a drunk, in love with Ann and/or Harris. I don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment.<br /><br />And, really, didn't we learn from Bridges of Madison County that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in, to scenes of our heroes' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights, simply does not work on film? This film is a disaster. Skip it.","The reviewer was dissatisfied with the movie Evening due to the drastic differences between the characters in the film and those in the original book. They criticized the adaptation for straying too far from the source material and creating a confusing and unfaithful representation. Additionally, the reviewer expressed disappointment in the film's storytelling methods, particularly the interruptions of the main narrative with unrelated scenes featuring the characters' grown children. Ultimately, they deemed the movie a disaster and advised skipping it."
Was the star-studded cast able to salvage the film's shortcomings?,"Cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love...<br /><br />This is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is. Not bad as such but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes,Natasha Richardson,Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson,Hugh Darcy and others (all giving fine performances) you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance.<br /><br />Wait for Cable.","Despite the star-studded cast that includes Vanessa Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, and others giving commendable performances, the movie falls short of the expectations set by such a talented ensemble. While the plot may seem intriguing at first, it ultimately devolves into a predictable, melodramatic story that fails to offer anything more than a typical romance novel. Save your time and wait to catch this one on cable TV."
How did the casting choices impact the overall performance in the movie Evening?,"Almost as tedious to watch as it was to read, Evening is a gorgeously produced failure...until Meryl Streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff. Vanessa Redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young Ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older Ann actually was dying. <br /><br />I was hoping the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas. It gave me a headache.","The casting choices in the movie Evening negatively impacted the overall performance. Vanessa Redgrave was shockingly off in her role as the dying Ann, while Claire Danes failed to impress. The lackluster performances of these two main actresses made the film tedious to watch. Despite Meryl Streep's standout performance, the mismatched casting hindered the storytelling and failed to engage the audience. Additionally, the jumpy storytelling added by Michael Cunningham only served to confuse the viewers and give them a headache."
"What are some common criticisms of the movie ""Groundbreaking""?","I looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a little. ""Groundbreaking"" is a little over the top. This is a Boston based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film. It's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. A silly action film without much creativity. It's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it. Not something you will ever see unless you are a student at Emerson college.","The movie ""Groundbreaking"" falls short of expectations as an amateur college production with limited creativity, depicting a silly action film that is entertaining only if you are willing to make fun of it. The movie fails to achieve the level of most amateur college films and is unlikely to appeal to audiences outside of the Emerson College community."
What were the main issues that the reviewer had with the movie?,"It is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today. maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties, and I am out of touch with todays movie going generation, and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie, since so many people loved it. I found it foul and vulgar. I haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I am not a politically correct person, and even I found the gay jokes, not only not funny but downright offensive ( I'm not gay). The main character in the movie is not even a likable person, just pathetic. When the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see.","The reviewer found the humor in the movie to be crude and sophomoric, with offensive gay jokes that were not only unfunny but also disrespectful. They also disliked the main character, describing them as pathetic and unlikable. Overall, the reviewer felt disappointed and considered the movie to be foul and vulgar."
What turned off you and your wife about this movie?,"About 15 minutes in, my wife was already wanting to leave. Not so much because of the material, but the lack thereof. They decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. When this would let up (very rare), we'd sit back and watch (not laughing, mind you) and wait for the next gross-out or offensive remark(s). After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we'd read said how great this was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it ""intelligent"" and said it wasn't a crude sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've ever walked out on...and I have no regrets. I'm sick of trying to go see comedies in America.","The film was disappointingly filled with vulgar language and offensive remarks, lacking the humor it promised. Despite the high praise it received, the excessive gross-out content made it unbearable to watch, prompting the viewer to leave within just 35 minutes."
What did you find particularly disappointing about the film?,"Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, leaden and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. Despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed.","This film is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The script is poorly written, the cast delivers cringeworthy performances, and the story is all over the place. The humor falls flat, the characters are one-dimensional, and there's a disturbing underlying tone of misogyny throughout the movie. Even the supposed happy ending feels forced and unsatisfying. Overall, a complete waste of time and a prime example of how not to make a film."
What makes this film unappealing to a mature audience?,"After we counted the use of the f word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film, listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse, and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together, well, we turned it off. Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie, the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers. <br /><br />We did give it a second chance, thinking surely it would get better. No dice. Later, my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved, still no dice.<br /><br />The main character did have a cool bike.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents, or frat boys.","The excessive use of profanity, juvenile humor, poor acting, and lack of originality make this film a tedious watch for anyone looking for a more sophisticated viewing experience. The reliance on crass language and shallow jokes outweighs any positive aspects, such as the cool bike ridden by the main character. Only those seeking mindless entertainment or with a penchant for immaturity may find some enjoyment in this film."
What is the overall tone and style of the movie?,"At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40 Year Old Virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin. But then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years?<br /><br />One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs. They've done the gross out movies. They've done the let's act like all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /><br />This film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it.","The movie is crass and crude, relying on shallow characters and immature humor to try and generate laughs. It fails to offer anything substantial or meaningful."
What elements make this movie a huge disappointment?,"This is one of the most insipid, lackluster, unoriginal, and pointless movies ever made! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie. This is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best film of them all. As for this waste of film stock, Burt Reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors aren't given very much to do, the car races are obviously stock footage, the humor is uninspired, and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours. ""Stroker Ace"" is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it.","The movie is criticized for being insipid, unoriginal, and pointless, feeling like the cast didn't put in much effort. Burt Reynolds is said to just go through the motions, the humor is dull, and the overall film lacks any unique or distinctive qualities, making it a waste of time."
"Was ""Stroker Ace"" a film worth watching?","Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions. He'd show up, party with his friends on film, and take home a big paycheck. It didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap.<br /><br />No film epitomized this more than ""Stroker Ace"" which makes ""Cannonball Run"" look like a classic and ""Cannonball Run II"" look watchable. Save for a few race scenes there is absolutely NOTHING worth seeing here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing.<br /><br />If the thought of Burt hamming it up with Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie. Otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't be any worse.","""Stroker Ace"" was a prime example of lackluster performances and weak storyline, leaving little to be desired. Burt Reynolds and the rest of the cast seemed to be merely going through the motions without any real heart or dedication to their roles. The attempts at humor fell flat, especially Loni Anderson's portrayal of a dumb blonde. Unless you find joy in watching Burt Reynolds dress up as a chicken and engage in subpar race scenes, this movie is better off avoided."
"What makes this Columbo episode a major flop according to the reviewer? 
Negative","Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime, Columbo smokes out killer, Columbo becomes a pest in the process), the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in the extreme, and the result is a major flop.<br /><br /> Would you believe: Columbo never faces the villain till the very end?!!<br /><br />Frankly, I was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds through.<br /><br /> Oh, the sacrifices we self-appointed reviewers make!!!","This episode deviates too much from the traditional formula, leading to a lackluster storyline and an unsatisfying viewing experience. The absence of Columbo facing the villain until the very end may be a major turnoff for fans of the series, making it tempting to stop watching halfway through."
Do you think the movie involves a coherent plot and stays true to the essence of Columbo?,"I love Columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot. A mind-bogglingly tedious, pointless, muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored-looking Peter Falk. The 'plot', such as it is, just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with. One part of the proceedings which I found extremely puzzling ( or possibly annoying ) was Peter Falk's character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If the producers insist on keeping Columbo's first name a secret, why couldn't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous? Like I said, this is the pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague.",
What let down the viewers while watching this movie?,"Absolute garbage. The reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /><br />The supposed star didn't do anything to solve the case - and neither did anyone else really - it was just routine police work. Utterly tedious.<br /><br />You sat right till the end hoping for a twist - and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /><br />There was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap. Could the Lt's personal involvement finally cloud his judgement? <br /><br />All the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it. But surely a genius like Lt C, by constant conversation with the wronged husband, would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.","The movie was a complete disappointment filled with a pathetic plot and unimpressive characters. Despite the potential for an engaging storyline with a relative's apparent kidnap, the narrative fell flat and failed to deliver any intriguing twists or surprises. The lackluster police work and the absence of a genius-like revelation left the audience feeling utterly bored and dissatisfied. Overall, it was a waste of time to sit through this movie."
What are some aspects of the movie that disappointed viewers?,"An uninspired and undistinguished ""new"" Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates...<br /><br />And that it is about it: indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script, given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk, who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story ""Murder Under Glass"" in the detective's heyday; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding, which include everybody who was there!<br /><br />Devoid of every Columbo trait possible, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the history of the series, with appropriately soap-opera style acting. Very avoidable stuff.","The film was a letdown to fans of the original Columbo series. The plot lacked depth, the script was flat, and the absence of a murder mystery was a major drawback. The film failed to capture the essence of Columbo, feeling more like an episode of a completely different show. The acting came across as melodramatic, and overall, the movie was deemed as avoidable and insult to the legacy of the series."
What are some common criticisms of this show?,"This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational? No. the Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they don't try teaching anything.<br /><br />Is it funny? No. The Doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it.<br /><br />Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop's. Therefore, they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />The show is also extremely cheesy. Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. It's overkill.<br /><br />For kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. They'll never know how to grow up.","The show is often described as lacking educational content, humor, and realism. It is criticized for its exaggerated and cheesy dialogue, overly bright colors, and the unrealistic portrayal of constant positivity without exposing children to negative emotions. The lack of depth in the content may be entertaining for very young children but is not recommended for older kids who could benefit from a more well-rounded viewing experience."
What aspects of the show do children find unsettling or unappealing?,My children watch the show everyday that its on. Its a great program for younger children. However they need to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't ever brush their teeth? Does the show ever make its way to the United States and if so where can we find its schedule at. And one other thing if we might be able to add. Moe you need to stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope? What does that signify? other then getting wet all the time. They need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole. Kids loose interest that way.,"The constant airing of reruns is tiresome for both children and parents. The characters Rooney and Deedee's yellow teeth are distracting and off-putting, making viewers question their dental hygiene. The sudden appearances of Moe and his habit of hiding startle younger children, while the repetitive use of certain elements like the rope-pulling lacks creativity and becomes predictable. The lack of new content and failure to address these issues may lead to a decline in children's interest in the show."
Was the film able to live up to its promised budget of $20 million dollars?,"Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million.<br /><br />Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750,000 if not considerably less than that. Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish.<br /><br />It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget.<br /><br />Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum.","The film, despite initial claims of a $20 million budget, falls short in terms of production quality, with obvious indications of being made on a significantly lower budget, resulting in incomplete and amateurish effects, minimal sets, and several scenes shot against green screen. The disappointment of the discrepancy between the promised budget and the actual outcome makes it a painful and misguided watch for viewers who had high hopes for the film."
What is your opinion on the movie adaptation of H.G. Wells's classic?,"Finally i thought someone is going to do justice to H.G. Wells's classic , not another version set in the wrong locale or era , but one based firmly on the book . Well it definitely follows the book pretty closely , and that is the only plus to this mess.<br /><br />This is 180 Min's (yes 3 hours) long , the book is only around 150 pages .<br /><br />If Timothy Hines had the nerve to come on here and say ""if you can do any better ..."" i would say ""yes , i could"" and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life.<br /><br />I paid good money to get this crap over to the UK from the USA , do not make the same mistake as me .","Many fans have expressed disappointment in the film's excessively long runtime of 3 hours compared to the short length of the original book. The lack of quality in the production and direction has left viewers feeling like they wasted their money, with some even going as far as warning others not to bother watching it."
Can you describe the visual effects in the movie?,"Holy freaking God all-freaking-mighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way... The character acting is the poorest thing I've seen in quite some time. This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO(it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. They're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. Then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be sub-par to 1992's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, Come on, really. It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.","The visual effects in this movie were extremely poor, resembling something you would see in a low-budget 90s TV show rather than a modern film. From the bad green screen effects to the laughable CGI horse, it was clear that the quality was far below what is expected in today's cinema."

Would you recommend watching this film?,"WOW!<br /><br />I just was given this film from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt that he got taken! It is beyond boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the acting is somewhat improvised, almost as if they didn't have a script. The Martians are CGI, which look like they were done by a novice, or a Fan produced movie. I cannot stress just how bad this DVD really is!<br /><br />Example: In one of the scenes, the martians are torturing a local female captive. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen, to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is totally noticeable, and when she is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, looking like something from a game back in 1990!<br /><br />If at all possible, avoid this movie like the plague! You can download two trailers from their site, and see how god-awful it really is!","This film was a complete disaster. The special effects were amateurish, the acting felt unscripted, and the CGI Martians were laughably bad. Scenes where the characters interact with the CGI were cringeworthy, making it painfully obvious that they were not actually part of the same world. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this movie at all costs. It's a prime example of how low-budget filmmaking can go terribly wrong."
"What are some shortcomings of the movie ""Exorcism Reunion""?","A young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself. 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won't turn out like his father. All the stock characters are in place: the nice couple; the ""funny"" guy; the tough (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses--that's how we know); the nerd and two no-personality blondes. It all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life (don't ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a great opening scene, we jump to 20 years later--ALL bad horror movies do that!<br /><br />The dialogue is atrocious, the acting is bad (except for Betsy Palmer--why Betsy?) and the killings are stupid and/or unimaginative. My favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed! A real bad, stupid incoherent horror film. Avoid at all costs.","The movie ""Exorcism Reunion"" falls flat due to its poor dialogue, bad acting, and unimaginative killings. The characters are flat and stereotypical, the plot lacks coherence, and the overall viewing experience is disappointing. Avoid this film if you can."
What were the main shortcomings of the film?,"Mike Hawthorne(Gordon Currie)is witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father Morty(Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends to his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where the guests confess and confront their worst fears...Mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father. It is soon discovered that Morty's spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the blood bath begins.<br /><br />Most of the F/X are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme. Stale story pitifully acted. Cast members of note are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.","The movie features unconvincing special effects and dives into a clichéd teenage slasher theme, resulting in a stale storyline with pitiful acting. The cast, including Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon, and Betsy Palmer, failed to elevate the film with their performances."
Can you please offer a more detailed analysis of the plot and characters in the movie?,"I have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to. <br /><br />Having just watched it a few hours ago I am struggling to remember a thing about it. <br /><br />From what I remember it's main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from Friday the 13th and are stalked by plank of wood man.<br /><br />Some people die, the film ends, I am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /><br />I will pay u £1 to take this film off my hands......oh wait I already gave it away to a ""friend"".","The movie failed to leave a lasting impression and was forgettable even immediately after watching it. The plot was weak, featuring annoying characters and a lackluster storyline with unremarkable deaths. The antagonist, known as plank of wood man, failed to evoke any fear or suspense. Overall, this movie felt like a waste of time and left the viewer seeking compensation for the time lost."
What were the major issues that led to the disappointment of the show?,"Before starting to watch the show, I've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception, the scripts are so dumb that I am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And what about the SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to watch, colors are not saturated they are over saturated, like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated. This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility.","The show turned out to be a massive letdown despite high expectations. The scripts are poorly written, resembling something a child would come up with. The visual effects and colors are so overwhelmingly exaggerated that it becomes a struggle to watch. It's like a poorly made pie with only sugar and butter - lacking substance and credibility."
What expectations did the audience have for the movie prior to viewing it?,"This was an awful movie! Not for the subject matter, but for the delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, with no uplift at the end. The previews and ads made NO mention of this! Plus, for all that they played up whoopi goldberg, my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that, but it's just more of the problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would've never have seen it. Or at least, I would've been prepared for it. This was a bait and switch ad campaign, and I will NEVER see this movie again!","Many viewers were disappointed with the movie's delivery, as it deviated from the uplifting themes they expected and instead focused on brutal police oppression with a lack of resolution. The misleading marketing campaign did not prepare them for the depressing content, leading to feelings of being deceived and ultimately dissatisfied with the film."
What makes the concept of Sarafina fall short in the eyes of critics and audience members alike?,"The concept for Sarafina appears to be a sound one, that is aside from the musical perspective. It attempts to combine upbeat African music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror. Had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film, however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs. <br /><br />Aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, Goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast. Overall a disappointment.<br /><br />3/10","The concept of Sarafina attempts to blend African music with a serious storyline but ultimately fails to justify the drastic tonal shifts between joy and tragedy. The juxtaposition of upbeat music with scenes depicting violence and oppression doesn't resonate well with viewers. Additionally, the acting performances, including Whoopi Goldberg's, are criticized for being lackluster and failing to elevate the film. Overall, Sarafina is deemed a disappointment by many, scoring a low 3/10 rating."
What is the general tone of the movie review?,"I just didn't get this movie...Was it a musical? no..but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it...<br /><br />Was it a serious drama....no the acting was not good enough for that.<br /><br />Is Whoopi Goldberg a quality serious Actor..Definently not.<br /><br />I had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie. The message on apartheid and the ""tribute"" to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted. But as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse.<br /><br />See for yourself, but in fairness I hated it","The movie was confusing in terms of genre, unclear if it was a musical or a serious drama. The acting, particularly Whoopi Goldberg's, was not perceived as strong or believable. The disjointed nature of the film made it difficult for the viewer to stay engaged, with the movie being deemed as poor entertainment and an ineffective documentary-style film."
What are some major flaws of the film?,"This film has got several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. This means that the film cannot captivate it's audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very BAD! Do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.","The film lacks a good plot which makes it difficult to watch and discourages the audience from being engaged. It leaves viewers feeling hopeless and wastes their time, ultimately leading to contempt towards the film and everything related to it."
Can you elaborate on what specifically made this movie so awful?,"It was meant to be a parody on the LOTR-Trilogy. But this was one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I don't doubt any second that there are people who'll like this sense of ""humor"", but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. I'm working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: At the movies it was a nice (but no big at all) success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast. In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore. In the last ten years, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which one was worse, but I'm happy that there a so many good movies so I don't have to think too much on this question.","The movie was a failed attempt at parodying the LOTR-Trilogy, with bad acting, a weak screenplay, and overall poor execution. The sense of humor fell flat, lacking the cleverness seen in parodies by acclaimed directors like Mel Brooks. The movie initially had some success in theaters, but quickly dropped off due to negative reviews. Similarly, DVD sales were only good for a short period before interest faded. In a decade of movie watching, this film ranks among the worst alongside other forgettable titles."
What are some criticisms that can be made about the movie?,"This is a movie of tired, yet weirdly childish, clichés. There's a Nazi witch master performing sf-related experiments in the basement? Oh please! <br /><br />Aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear, the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright. Not having any expectations beforehand, I am left with: an aged Xander from Buffy and a heroine with ape-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act. Said Adrienne Barbeau have I only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"".<br /><br />Camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame.","The movie's attempt at horror falls short due to its immature and cliché storyline featuring a Nazi witch master and poor acting. The characters, including an unconvincing heroine and an aged Xander from Buffy, do little to elevate the film. The camera work and editing also contribute to a lackluster viewing experience, adding to the overall feeling of lameness."
What were some major disappointments in the film adaptation of Rice's novel?,"I read Rice's novel with interest, and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths.<br /><br />However, I was simply APPALLED at this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based merely on physical appearance, and not acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither blond-haired, or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag). The cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a French accent was hilarious, but not in an entertaining way. I found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe, and was surprised I made it to the end.<br /><br />A warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one.","The casting choices were based solely on looks rather than acting ability, with only Peter Gallagher standing out. The attempt at French accents by the cast was awkward and inconsistent, making the film a cringeworthy and melodramatic mess. Fans of the novel should steer clear of this disastrous adaptation."
"Can you provide a negative review of the movie ""Interview with the Vampire""?","The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too""real"" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show.

(sorry for the ambiguity, but I don't want to give anything away) Sorry, but it's just not my type of show.","The movie was deemed too depressing by some viewers who dislike such films. Additionally, Eartha Kitt's character was perceived as creepy and negatively impacted the overall viewing experience for them."
Was the movie 'The Dorm That Dripped Blood' worth watching for slasher fans?,"College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.<br /><br />** out of ****","The Dorm That Dripped Blood falls short in many aspects for slasher fans. The production values are low, the story is mostly routine with a forgettable build-up, and the cast is lackluster overall. While there are a few brutal murders that stand out, much of the movie fails to leave a lasting impact. The presence of a creepy bum as a red herring adds little to the plot. It can be considered a standard B slasher effort with only the intense climax and bold conclusion saving it from being a complete disappointment."
What makes this slasher film fall short of expectations?,"Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If not her, than what other reason to watch this. five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition. Problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting, and the group are short a few people. Then, a killer is on the loose. I honestly wanted to say I was going to enjoy this one. It had a fair set up, or maybe that was just Daphne Zuniga in it. The film is too slow, and almost as silent as a library. Most of the acting is below average, and the ""point-of-view"" moments are so old news. Acclaimed composer Christopher Young of such films as ""Hellraiser"" and ""Entrapment"" scored this, in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a TV movie. Still, it seems higher than the movie deserves. So, other than Young and Zuniga, this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel.","The film fails to deliver excitement and engages the audience poorly. The slow pacing, lackluster acting, and cliché ""point-of-view"" scenes make it a tedious watch. Even the acclaimed composer Christopher Young's score feels out of place and repetitive. Without Daphne Zuniga's performance, there is hardly any reason to endure this mediocre movie."
Would you recommend this movie to someone looking for a truly scary and suspenseful experience?,"I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain. This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are not very gory, so this video nastie is not really nasty. There is the requisite flashing of the boobies, but it has nothing to do with the college kids.<br /><br />I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality.","The film lacks the gory and intense scenes typically associated with slasher movies. The characters are predictable, and the overall plot feels overdone. The few suspenseful moments are overshadowed by unnecessary nudity that adds no value to the story."
Would you recommend this movie to others?,"The two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities.<br /><br />First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in, and that is that. She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.<br /><br />Second, the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah, I know one star more is not much, but in this movie's case, it is a lot.<br /><br />The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down, getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah...we all know where this is going.<br /><br />Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.","The movie relies heavily on the performances of two unknown celebrities, with Daphne Zuniga standing out in the beginning but not enough to save the film. The plot is predictable and filled with cliche horror tropes, making it feel like a senseless and boring watch. The only saving grace is the musical score by composer Christopher Young, but even that is not enough to make this film worth recommending to others."
What made this slasher movie disappointing for you?,"This one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie.<br /><br />The Holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.<br /><br />The clichès are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so does the mystery.<br /><br />This is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />I am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash.","According to the reviewer, the slasher movie had poor production values, a stupid plot, lack of coherence in events, boring clichés, minimal gore, and a lack of mystery. They expressed disappointment in the movie and even mentioned that it should not be hyped despite having a video nastie label."
What did you find disappointing about the movie despite having high expectations due to the cast and director?,"My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the movie would have to be at least worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up on it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was, for me, impossible to get past -- hard to believe this is England when no one talks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to echo a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous. There is no reason to care about any of the characters, which is why we threw in the towel halfway through. I found it hard to believe that Hawks directed this, as none of the actors spoke with the trademark Hawksian rat-a-tat delivery. So save your time, and skip this one.","This movie failed to capture the audience's interest with its lack of chemistry between the actors, unrealistic character development, and the absence of the director's signature style. The mismatch between the actors' accents and their supposed nationalities made it hard to connect with the storyline, leading to a lack of emotional investment in the characters. Overall, the movie fell short of expectations and left viewers feeling disconnected and uninterested."
Do the characters in the movie speak like real people?,"Couldn't believe it! Clipped sentences? Good grief! Know what? All true! Real people ever talk like this? Don't think so. Good girl! Stout fellow! Stiffen upper lip! Only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish. Movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights. Seemed endless, anyway. Think all Franchot Tone's dialogue dubbed. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British they come over as Irish. Handy tip - we Brits clip words, not sentences. And somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time. But that's only if we've been to a really good public (that's private to you) school.","The dialogue in the movie is clipped and unnatural, making it hard to believe that real people would speak this way. The only saving grace is Gary Cooper's presence, but overall the movie feels ridiculous unless you enjoy endless biplane dogfights. The attempts by Crawford and Young to sound British come off as more Irish, and it seems like Franchot Tone's dialogue was dubbed. The portrayal of British speech patterns seems off, as Brits are said to clip words, not sentences, and the overall dialogue feels inauthentic."
"What makes ""Starlight"" a memorable viewing experience?","I finally caught up to ""Starlight"" last night on television and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects (check out the laser beams shooting out of Willie's eyes!), the atrocious acting, the ponderous dialogue, the mismatched use of stock footage, or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production. This truly is a one-of-a-kind experience, and we should all be thankful for that. I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true heir to Ed Wood!","""Starlight"" may seem like a trainwreck of a movie with laughable special effects, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and an overall sense of trying too hard. It comes across as a poor attempt at a serious production, reminiscent of the works of Ed Wood."
"What did you think of the movie ""City girl Meg Tilly""?","City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home to her family's rural digs, only to be faced with a mystery: why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways? Radiation thriller, with barely a nod to ecology, has small town residents going berserk, which (laughably) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench. The picture is too silly for words, wasting Tilly's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of. Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is good (particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage), though he is let down by the scrappy editing--and a fairly bathetic finale. Simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve. *1/2 from ****","The movie ""City girl Meg Tilly"" seemed to lack originality and coherence. Despite some decent cinematography, the film failed to deliver on its potential, leaving the audience with a confusing and often ridiculous storyline. The characters' behaviors felt forced and unrealistic, and the screenplay offered no surprises or fresh ideas. Overall, the movie came across as silly and disappointing, ultimately wasting the talent of the lead actress on a poorly executed plot."
What made you fall asleep during the film?,"I have been known to fall asleep during films, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot. However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish. The plot development was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why. I admit, I may have missed part of the film, but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else. I cant recommend this film at all.","The plot development was slow and boring, with things happening without any clear explanation or reason, making it hard to stay engaged."
Were you satisfied with the level of suspense and scare factor in the movie Prom Night?,"So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.<br /><br />I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.<br /><br />Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero ""jump-in-your-seat"" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD.","Prom Night failed to deliver on its promise of being a horror and thriller movie, as it lacked any real suspense or fear-inducing moments. The plot was decent, but the predictability of the storyline made it difficult to take the movie seriously. Save your money and wait for it to be available on DVD instead of watching it in theaters."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""Prom Night""?","If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible ""horror"" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time.<br /><br />Despite it being a horror film, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché's you can fit in one movie scares you. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of ""Prom Night"", you screwed up. The actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting. This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip. I'd sooner go and see ""One Missed Call"" again, at least that had some plot.","Despite being a horror film, it lacks scares and is filled with cliché horror elements. The film's rating suggests it could have been better and the acting suffers due to questionable scripting. Overall, it is considered a waste of time and money."
What did you think of the overall quality of the movie?,"I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too. Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.","I thought it was an overrated PG-13 crap. The leads' friends' performances were not convincing, and the killer looked stupid. The deaths were unoriginal, boring, and the movie lacked suspense, almost making me fall asleep. The ending was stupid, the climax rushed, and the movie overall was dreadful, with only Brittany Snow's and Idris Elba's performances standing out."
What were some major flaws in the movie that led to a disappointing viewing experience?,"The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay. It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes. The ending was even worse. Everyone kept dying, but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could have really made this an OK film, but the screenplay and acting failed miserably.","The acting and screenplay were both incredibly bad, making it hard to take the movie seriously. The murder scenes were laughably poorly executed, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. The lack of backstory and character development left the audience feeling disconnected and confused. Overall, the film failed to deliver a compelling storyline due to its subpar acting and writing."
What are some flaws of the movie you noticed while watching it?,"i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident...well it must of been. blonde women being stalked,the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing,hiding.he was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did it.he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not hard to do.<br /><br />the old ""mirror in the bathroom""is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago. you had the cop on the trail of the villain,another cliché(played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent,he's from London) the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché's and make's ""scary move""which was a COMEDY look scary. pathetic!","The movie was a mess from start to finish. The blonde women being stalked and the villain's unrealistic ability to teleport around made the plot nonsensical. The overused ""mirror in the bathroom"" cliche failed to evoke any scares, and the cop on the villain's trail was a tired trope. The director seemed clueless, resulting in a film filled with cliches that made even a comedy like ""Scary Movie"" look terrifying in comparison. Overall, the film was downright pathetic."
What did you think about the pacing of the movie and the performances of the actors?,"I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie was pain for me. I had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep. It was boring! How can somebody ruin this title so much? The story was the only good thing. Actors were sh.t. They can't live the role. The main actor(Tom ... ) is a null. Watch the other roles of this actor. The fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable,somehow they were not to follow the situation. Like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors.Maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title. French can't do right thing with big films,like Alien 4. That was bit brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.","The movie was incredibly boring and the actors failed to bring life to their roles. The main actor's performance was lackluster and the fighting scenes were not engaging. It felt like a low budget film with subpar acting, making it difficult to stay invested in the story. French filmmakers failed to do justice to the source material, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience reminiscent of other big film failures like Alien 4."
"What were your expectations going into the movie ""Largo Winch""?","In my knowledge, Largo winch was a famous Belgium comics (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a sort of James Bond without the spy life! So, when I had to choose a movie for a 5 years-old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of James Bond!<br /><br />But, just after the opening credits, I got heavy doubts: when American movies offer amazing start, here, no action and a torrid sex scene  Then, the story get very complicated with financial moves I thought I lost the kid.<br /><br />But, strangely, he had been caught by Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /><br />Was it the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship Largo has with his father? The multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends? The exotic locations of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /><br />Dunno, but he really cares about Largo (""Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.","While the movie ""Largo Winch"" seemed promising as an alternative to the usual action-packed films, I found myself disappointed by the lack of suitable content for a child audience. The inclusion of a torrid sex scene and complex financial elements made it less engaging for young viewers. Furthermore, the slow start and convoluted storyline may have alienated some audiences looking for a more straightforward and accessible viewing experience."
"What did you enjoy about the film ""The Soldier""?","Chilly, alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an Army Captain returning from duty in WWII with his memory impaired (now there's an original idea!). It seems he remembers old flame Glenda Jackson but not current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks. This extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret, and Ian Holm, but the burners are all on low. There are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever Jackson is on-screen), but Bridges' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film's dulled-out color is enervating. Long on the shelf, this ""Soldier"" is best left forgotten. *1/2 from ****","The film ""The Soldier"" is a slow-paced adaptation of Rebecca West's book that fails to fully engage the audience. Despite a talented cast, including Alan Bates, Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie, Ann-Margret, and Ian Holm, the emotional depth of the characters falls flat. The storytelling lacks energy, and the muted colors drain the viewing experience of any excitement. Overall, the film feels forgettable and struggles to keep the audience invested in the plot."
What are some of the main reasons why the movie failed to impress the audience?,"When I bought this DVD I though: ""It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in Portuguese standards let's give it a chance"" I was TOTALLY WRONG! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so boring, and leads nowhere It has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one or another direction The production is also bad! The sound mixing is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80's The acting should have been better too Well, to sum up, it's not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen in the last years! Bad argument, bad acting, bad production I had no high hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I've ever imagined! Just forget about it!","The movie turned out to be a disappointment as it strayed from the expected light comedy genre and instead presented a poorly executed drama with a boring plot that lacked structure. The production quality was subpar with issues in sound mixing, and the acting was not up to par. Overall, the film failed to make a positive impact and ended up being one of the worst Portuguese movies in recent years."
"What are some of the reasons why ""Paris, Je t'aime"" may not be worth watching?","I've never been to Paris, but after seeing ""Paris, Je t'aime"" I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I LOVE the city and its boroughs. I kinda expected to be touched by this film, to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away, but, lo and behold, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine. Maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own. Can't you find love in New York?","""Paris, Je t'aime"" failed to deliver a compelling narrative that would evoke the desired emotions in the audience. The lack of genuine love stories or meaningful connections between characters left viewers feeling disappointed and disengaged. The portrayal of dysfunctional relationships and failed interactions did not effectively capture the essence of Paris as a romantic city. Overall, the film fell short in delivering a captivating and memorable viewing experience."
Do you think the movie was successful in portraying the essence of New York and its inhabitants?,"An anthology is always risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised. There's a lot of talent involved here. A great many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had.<br /><br />First of all, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them clash with the others. <br /><br />Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped to me. Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even an ending period) but rather, they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in. <br /><br />Last but not least, I did not feel New-York and its inhabitants were properly portrayed.<br /><br />What you're left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied.","The movie's downfall lies in its disconnected and uneven segments that clash in tone and quality, leaving some underdeveloped and unsatisfying stories that fail to draw the viewer in. Additionally, the portrayal of New York and its inhabitants fell short of capturing the essence, ultimately making it a less engaging watch."
What flaws did you notice in the film that made you walk out of the screening?,"The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the cesspool.","The movie lacked substantial storyline, authenticity, and seemed to overly focus on bizarre and sexual themes throughout. The overall experience felt artificial, leading to a disappointing and ultimately unengaging viewing that led me to leave the theater before it ended."
Can you elaborate on the negatives of the movie?,"I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant ""A Double Life"" and the funny ""Born Yesterday"" and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as ""Adam's Rib"" and ""Pat And Mike"" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome, sad drivel as ""Bachelor Mother"", ""Some Kind Of A Nut"", and this. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script sinks to it's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which Janssen's character tests Drivas's character to make sure he's not gay. An ugly sequence, but sadly one which could easily play in a film today. ""Ethnic"" jokes are now totally verboten, but ""fag"" jokes are still ""good, clean, family fun"".","The film falls flat due to a tired and clichéd script, leaving even the talented cast unable to save it. The offensive sequence testing a character's sexuality is particularly distasteful, highlighting the film's lack of sensitivity and outdated humor."
Did this movie deliver on the expectations set by its title and predecessor?,"I was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic ""Private Lessons"" which portrays the dream of any male teenager.<br /><br />""Private Lessons II"" has NOTHING to do with the title I mention. It's just a regular soft-core Cinemax flick that won't make a change in your life. There's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it. I watched this a long time ago but believe me, this is just a regular boring soft core flick.<br /><br />The women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable.","Unfortunately, ""Private Lessons II"" failed to live up to the anticipation as it veered away from the storyline of the cult classic and ended up being just a mundane, forgettable soft-core film. Despite some aesthetically pleasing actors, the lack of substance and depth in the plot makes it a unimpressive choice for viewing, with only one standout scene that doesn't justify the overall dullness of the movie. It's better to pass on this one unless it's the only option available on television."
What aspects of the movie might disappoint viewers other than Jackie Chan's die-hard fans?,"Up until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is possibly Jackie Chan's worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with). The final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of ""comedy"" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless ""football"" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line ""How can I turn it off? It's not a tap"" - watch to find out what it refers to). ""Dragon Lord"" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies. (**)","The majority of the film is filled with childish humor, tedious football scenes, and cringe-worthy dubbing. It requires enduring these flaws to reach a redeeming final fight sequence."
"What aspects of the film ""Caged Heat"" failed to live up to the expectations of a 70s exploitation film?","First of all, I was expecting ""Caged Heat"" to be along the same lines as ""Ilsa, The Wicked Warden"". Boy, was I wrong! In no way is this film 70s exploitation, ""chix in chains"", or ""women in prison"". Sure, the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison, who wear street clothes btw (quite comical), but NOTHING happens.<br /><br />There aren't strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape, and no inmates make out. There are 2 shower scenes, that I suspect is just recycled footage, but no fights breaks out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! Aside from the lack of plot, unconvincing, unsympathetic, and flat characters, a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to ""free"" their fellow inmates??!!<br /><br />PUH-LEASE, the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset...as opposed to letting this mess continue!<br /><br />I feel scammed.","The lack of plot, unconvincing characters, and absence of any exciting or engaging sequences make ""Caged Heat"" a disappointing and unsatisfying watch. You're left feeling scammed and wondering why the movie continued instead of just ending with the escapees riding off into the sunset."
Can you provide a negative review of the movie using the provided positive reviews?,"Where to start... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price I paid, got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller. The only THRILL I got was watching Kirkland's lousy rendition of Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy woodland area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least half way decent, then don't even bother.<br /><br />I for one enjoy crappy films, the worse the better in most cases. But Wow... I Meant WOW!! The only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason why I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.","The movie was a disappointment for those expecting a thrilling experience, with only the young actor performing decently while the rest of the cast fell short. It may be worth a watch for a good laugh with friends on a casual night, but overall, the film missed the mark for those seeking quality entertainment."
How would you describe the overall humor and representation in the movie?,"Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who don't say much, just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny.<br /><br />Black comedy? There isn't a black person in it, and there isn't one funny thing in it either.<br /><br />Walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack. It's labeled Unrated. I think they took out the topless scene. They may have taken out other stuff too, who knows? All we know is that whatever they took out, isn't there any more.<br /><br />The acting seemed OK to me. There's a lot of unfathomables tho. It's supposed to be a city? It's supposed to be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves, why are they all wearing coats?","The movie lacks diversity and fails to deliver on its promise of black comedy. The humor falls flat, and the plot is confusing with inconsistencies in the setting. It may have been better off left on the bargain rack at Walmart."
What makes this film stand out as a disappointment among its genre peers?,"I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad film. It fails on pretty much all levels; the cast is awful, the acting - ham at best and the plot lacks any depth, leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines.<br /><br />Plan B has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy.<br /><br />A bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie.","The film falls short in every aspect - from the cast and acting to the plot, leaving viewers feeling apathetic and cringing at the poorly executed attempts at comedy. It is described as a saccharine-coated turd of a movie, lacking the charm expected in this genre."
What was your experience watching the movie 'Succubus'?,"'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma.<br /><br />Jess Franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on Class A hallucinogenics, since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever. Apparently, this is one of the better of his 180+ films  it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there.<br /><br />The unfathomable plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S&M for good measure, and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious.<br /><br />I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again  life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this.","The movie 'Succubus' was a struggle to sit through, filled with dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror. The plot was unfathomable and made no sense, with unclear themes of sex, violence, lesbianism, and S&M. Overall, it was a mind-numbingly tedious film that was hard to believe was considered one of Jess Franco's better works. Life is too short to waste on watching bilge like this."
"When are we going to see the Campions, Jacksons, and the Tamahori's breaking ground with compelling, cinematically-told stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?<br />","A disappointing film.<br /><br />The story established our protagonist as Chrissy, a 'young', rather sullen individual drifting, not doing much. Actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives. It's a pity though, Chrissy seem like interesting character.<br /><br />Story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated. So the question now is, when are we going to see the Campions, Jacksons, and the Tamahori's breaking ground with compelling, cinematically-told stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?<br /><br />Technically, a disgusting shot film.","The story established our protagonist as Chrissy, a 'young', rather sullen individual drifting, not doing much.

What were some disappointing aspects of the movie adaptation in comparison to the book?,"I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it makes me mad. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The ending for example! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze... yeah, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. Halloran! what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important. Overall, it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off.","The movie failed to capture the depth and intensity of King's novel ""The Shining"". The deviations from the original story, such as the unnecessary maze and the unjust treatment of a key character, left a lot to be desired."
Can you explain why some viewers may not enjoy watching The Shining?,"Not the best of the films to be watched nowadays. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and was expecting it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and environment was good, but there was no story here. Not was there a single moment of fright. I expected it to a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror no thriller. The only scene where I got scared was during the chapter change scene showing ""Wednesday"". There are lots of fragments i the movie. Most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown. Might be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not for the 21st century.","Many viewers may find The Shining disappointing due to the lack of a cohesive storyline and the absence of genuine horror and thrill. The film leaves many aspects unexplained and unexplored, making it difficult for viewers to connect with the characters or events depicted. Despite some positive elements like sound and atmosphere, the overall film may leave viewers feeling unfulfilled and longing for a more engaging and coherent narrative."
What were the main criticisms of the movie based on the review?,"Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.","The reviewer did not find the movie great and criticized the performances of all the actors except Jack and Danny. They particularly highlighted Shelly's performance as Wendy as bad, stating that she looked the same every time she got scared. They disliked the ending of the movie and expressed that the overall movie was stupid compared to the book. The reviewer recommended reading the book instead of watching the movie."
What elements of the movie failed to resonate with the reviewer?,"I am going to keep this short.This ""adaption"" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.<br /><br />My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series ....<br /><br />Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing ""masterpieces"" like ""eyes wide shut"".","The reviewer found the adaptation of the King book to be a bad joke with laughable performances by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. The storyline was described as an incoherent mess that strayed far from the original book, making the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance complete jokes. The reviewer advised those who want to understand the story's characters to stick to the TV series instead."
What are some major issues with this movie?,"This is not Michael Madsen's fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic it is. Sorry Michael. The cinematography was dark. All the other actors are unknowns. When watching it, it feels like a soft porn, but with no nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual overtones, since it is about a underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, except Michael Madsen's parts. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he got paid well for this lousy movie. It is something I would not be proud of. It is not even a B movie for cable, it is more like a F and it should never be shown, ever.","This movie was a complete disaster right from the start. The storyline was incredibly dull and uninteresting, leaving viewers bored and searching for something better to do. The acting, aside from Michael Madsen, was amateurish and lacked any depth or emotion. The dark cinematography only added to the dreariness of the film, making it nearly impossible to even see what was happening on screen. The attempt at creating a suspenseful atmosphere with the underground S & M killer plot fell flat, coming off more cheesy than thrilling. Overall, this movie is a shameful attempt at filmmaking that should be avoided at all costs."
What were the main pitfalls or inconsistencies that stood out in the movie based on the review?,"The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killers location, Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. One is left to ponder would an FBP agent hand a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female. It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen. It would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out.","The reviewer highlighted numerous flaws in the movie, including a significant continuity error where a revolver magically transformed into an automatic weapon, and questionable character choices that seemed unrealistic. Additionally, the film was critiqued for not fully showcasing the attractiveness of the female lead due to the restrictive R rating, suggesting that potentially engaging scenes were cut out, ultimately impacting the viewing experience."
What are some criticisms of the movie Lion King 1.5?,"Having watched both the Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both thoroughly. I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching. What a disappointment ! Disney must be getting desperate for revenues.<br /><br />Especially now that they lost the deal with pixar.<br /><br />Basically, they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or garbage can) and glued them together to make a<br /><br />quick buck. Unlike LK I & II, both of which had strong story lines.<br /><br />This movie hardly has a story at all. While the characters and animation are always fun to look at, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. Some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings.<br /><br />Disney - Shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!<br /><br />Next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work.","The movie lacks a strong storyline and seems like Disney put together leftover scenes to make a quick profit. Compared to Lion King I & II, Lion King 1.5 falls short in terms of content and depth, leaving viewers disappointed."
What are some shortcomings of this film?,"There really wasn't much of a story in this film. It loosely based itself off the events in the first Lion King movie. It is supposed to be how Timon and Pumbaa met via their aloneness. But there isn't much more than that.<br /><br />It mixes some scenes from the original, then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit. But still, is that it? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation.<br /><br />I guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, then this is it. But other than that, it does little justice for the animators. Disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions. It really was quite boring and could have used Jason Statham. ""D-""","The movie lacks a compelling story and heavily relies on loosely basing itself off the events of the first Lion King movie. It fails to provide sufficient depth in exploring how Timon and Pumbaa met, leaving the plot feeling empty and lacking in explanation. The incorporation of scenes from the original movie and the attempt to showcase slight changes in the characters' personas fall short of creating an engaging narrative. Overall, the film is deemed boring and unimpressive, indicating a need for improvement in storytelling and character development."
"What makes this movie particularly disappointing for you?

Negative","I really don't understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic.<br /><br />Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this film. But I don't think it is her own fault but the directors. He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.<br /><br />The star I'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed.<br /><br />Don't watch this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.","I really can't comprehend all the hype around this movie. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Eva Mendez may look good, but her performance in this movie is subpar. The blame doesn't solely fall on her shoulders though, as the director seems to have a knack for making everything appear fake - from the acting to the overall concept to the makeup. The only reason I'm giving a single star is for the potential that was completely botched in the execution. Save yourself the agony and skip this disaster, opt for a classic from filmmakers like Fellini, Woody Allen, or David Lynch instead."
What could have improved the overall impact of the film and left the audience with a more thought-provoking experience?,"I heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good. But I started watching the film (on my film-channel)and was interested. This could be a really great, darkly black satire on todays morals in media. The small featurettes on every contestent were good. It build up to something I wouldn't wanna miss. But when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. Here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb.<br /><br />The ending is so bad I give it a 1. Even if the film starts of promising.","The movie started off with an interesting premise and potential as a dark satire, but as it progressed, it lost its depth and resorted to implausible and silly scenarios. The ending was particularly disappointing, undermining the promising beginning and leaving a lackluster impression on the viewers."
What can leave loyal fans feeling cheated after investing time in a TV show?,"Let's see. In the ""St. Elsewhere"" finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child. ""Newhart"" ended by telling us that it had all been a dream. And ""Roseanne"" ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind. Very ""creative"". Annoying was more like it. Yes, it was just a TV show and wasn't at all reality. It's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or TV show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all ""real"". At least as far as the reality it portrays on screen. This type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. Now ""Newhart"" being all a dream? At least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. The idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the Best Series Finale Ever. Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.","Some TV show finales, like the one in ""Roseanne,"" can be frustrating and disappointing, especially when they reveal that everything was just a figment of a character's imagination or mind. It may come off as unoriginal and can make viewers feel like they wasted their time."
What are some of the main flaws in the movie Blazing Saddles?,"Blazing saddles! It's a fight between two estranged brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences, with dippy love-interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the TV whiz-kid behind ""Moonlighting"") smothers the darkly-textured comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with a presentation so slick, the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant. It has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature, but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities. These aren't even characters, they're plot functions. Barely-released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good. Winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed. *1/2 from ****","Blazing Saddles tries to bring forth a story about estranged brothers, but director Glenn Gordon Caron's presentation ends up drowning the dark comedy in an overly slick style. The characters lack depth and feel more like plot devices, making it hard for the audience to connect with them. Despite a talented cast, the movie falls short with a meandering plot and fails to leave a lasting impact."
Why does the movie waste so much time on unnecessary sequences?,"First, it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and to start doing the job. What a waste of time, we all know Hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere, simply proving to us that Hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. All of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action, intrigue and plot twists. By the time the real action gets going, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great as usual, and the other actors as well, but this is a dud of the first magnitude.","The movie takes a frustratingly long time to get to the actual plot, with over 30 minutes spent on unnecessary jail and hotel scenes that add nothing to the story. By the time the action finally starts, the audience is left feeling bored and disengaged, making it a disappointing watch overall."
"What elements led to the film ""The Domino Principle"" being a major misfire for director Stanley Kramer? Could the poor performance from Candice Bergen and the muddled story have contributed to its downfall?","What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very puzzling screenplay? Were there a few pieces left out on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very muddled story?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin. A major misfire by Stanley Kramer.","Question: What elements led to the film ""The Domino Principle"" being a major misfire for director Stanley Kramer? Could the poor performance from Candice Bergen and the muddled story have contributed to its downfall?"
What are some drawbacks of the movie Superman and the Mole-Men based on the reviews?,"""You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive."" Ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi Yet despite the odd gem like that, Superman and the Mole-Men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time. It's beyond cheap (the one shot of Superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.","The movie is criticized for having a low budget with poorly executed special effects, such as a brief and unimpressive shot of Superman flying. Additionally, the film is described as uninspiring and dull despite its short runtime, lacking in engaging content to keep viewers interested. The appearance of the Mole-Men is also underwhelming, being likened more to strange humanoid creatures rather than the subterranean beings they are supposed to represent."
Can you provide some examples of the clichés present in the movie?,This movie was just plain bad. Just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for. Bad guy gets away? check. Partner? check. Wacky personality clash with partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. About the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but I guess they're saving those old chestnuts for Dooley's next outing. Add in the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like Dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.,"This movie was a total disappointment, falling into every predictable cop movie trope you can think of. From the bad guy getting away to the classic partner dynamic, this film offers nothing new or original. The forced wacky personality clash between the partners and the tired storyline of the rookie outshining the grizzled veteran make this movie a snooze fest. The attempt at incorporating Girl Power and the overused sight gags only add to the blandness of the film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this uninspired mess."
What are some aspects of the movie that could have been improved?,"The Biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say Zues takes DUTCH commands. But she is speaking German to him. The 2 languishes are completely different, its like saying ""well he takes French commands"" and start talking Spanish.<br /><br />James Belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest. The role just doesn't fit him, even if its mend to be a comedy.<br /><br />To many stereotype/predicable stuff. Typical comment or comebacks.<br /><br />If you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on TV. But i wouldn't suggesting renting it.","The movie suffers from a major inconsistency with the commands given to the dog, which may distract viewers. Additionally, James Belushi's portrayal as a detective falls flat, giving off more of a comedic vibe rather than a serious investigative one. The film also heavily relies on stereotypes and predictable storylines, making it less engaging for audiences. Overall, the movie may be watchable if it's on TV, but renting it is not recommended."
"What did some viewers find lacking in the film ""K-911""?","If you are one of the people who finds ""According to Jim"" great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. And might I add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, which prefers to air crap like Jim Belushi's show year after year.<br /><br />""K-911"" is a big, steaming, brown, German shepherd-sized ""thank you"" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie. It's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser Belushi deserve. Jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard. Look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee.<br /><br />If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your reward.","While fans of Jim Belushi may enjoy this movie, others may find it lacking in good talent and decent writing. The film seems to heavily rely on Jim's comedic abilities, which may not be enough to make it a truly entertaining watch for all audiences. Additionally, the humor may come off as forced and predictable, making it fall short of being a memorable comedy."
"What were some of the major disappointments in ""K-911""?","I was expecting a little something from ""K-911"", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice? :D <br /><br />3/10","The movie disappointed me, I was expecting a cute dog comedy but the plot was lackluster and the chemistry between the two main characters was off. The focus on James over the dogs was a letdown, and James' character came off as irritating and sexist. It felt like the dogs were the real stars of the movie, overshadowing the actors. Overall, the film felt stupid and didn't live up to expectations with a rating of 3/10."
"What were some disappointing aspects of the movie ""Fatal Error""?","I didn't expect much from this TV movie. You have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Still, it managed to disappoint, failing even to be a good-bad film.<br /><br />Every scene was by rote, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script, leaned back and said, ""My work is done"". It's all cliche, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the plot developments are laughable).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Watch ""The X-Files"" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. Also, let anyone know that sitting through ""Fatal Error"" is just that.","The movie felt like a compilation of cliches and predictable plot points, leaving the audience feeling unimpressed. The acting seemed forced, making it hard to take the film seriously even during laughable plot developments. The overall experience was lackluster and far from entertaining, making it difficult to recommend to others."
What unexpected twist does the movie take when it comes to the virus from Digicron?,"Robert Wagner is the evil boss of Digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.<br /><br />'so you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system' <br /><br />'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time'<br /><br />'but it's not going after software, it's killing people'<br /><br />watch out for the 'i'm into virology' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard","The movie fails to deliver a coherent explanation for the transformation of the software virus into a real virus capable of killing people. The transition from software to physical harm is poorly executed and leaves viewers scratching their heads. Additionally, the incorporation of virology and death by a braille keyboard feels forced and out of place in the overall plot."
"What shortcomings does the movie adaptation of ""Reaper"" have?","I have read the novel Reaper of Ben Mezrich a fews years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaption.<br /><br />Although it's been years since I read the story the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous. Very important elements, which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad.<br /><br />If the plot sounds interesting to you: go and get the novel. Its much, much, much better.<br /><br />Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by Ben Mezrich.","The movie adaptation of ""Reaper"" falls short compared to the novel, with significant changes that make the story less believable. Important elements are either omitted or altered for the worse, resulting in a less satisfying experience. It is recommended to opt for the novel instead, as it offers a much better portrayal of the plot. The movie only scores a 4 out of 10, mainly due to the intriguing plot provided by Ben Mezrich."
What social commentary elements does this amateurish effort contain?,"Like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine... The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention. One can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.<br /><br />I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes. Oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.",
What are some of the flaws in the film 'Fatal Error'?,"Despite its stereotypes, virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget I thought this film was alright; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichéd).<br /><br />The cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. I couldn't help thinking, though, that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like. Maybe it's just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.<br /><br />While it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard, 'Fatal Error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.","Despite the somewhat entertaining storyline, 'Fatal Error' falls short with its predictable plot, lackluster performances, and cheesy special effects. The film struggles to rise above its low-budget constraints, resulting in a forgettable viewing experience."
Do you think the concept of the computer virus becoming an organic virus was unrealistic and unrealistic?,"OK, the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale. This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier. Though, it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA, then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses? I could see that, but obviously, the writer didn't think of that.",The premise that a computer virus can transform into an organic virus in the movie is utterly ridiculous and contributes to misconceptions about computer viruses. The idea that something like an organic virus could emerge from a computer screen is far-fetched and lacks any scientific credibility. It's a shame that the writers didn't put more thought into creating a more plausible and believable storyline.
What elements of the movie failed to impress you?,"I've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot. I could make a better movie with my cellphone camera. How do they manage to get actors to play in those movies?? Porn movies have better scenarios and effects... I wish I had those 2 hours back...<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is the cast. Even though, their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable, the rest was just WAY too bad! <br /><br />It's the type of movie that I'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight.<br /><br />Even worse, I saw a translated version of this flick...Imagine, a bad movie...with an even worst translation...Yikes!","I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The storyline was weak, the acting was subpar, and the special effects were laughable. I could have probably made a better movie using my phone. The only redeeming quality was the cast, but even they couldn't salvage this disaster. It's the kind of movie I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemy. The translated version only made things worse, if that's even possible."
Would you recommend this show to someone looking for a confidence boost?,"Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people and I had an overwhelming sense that people hated me. However after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes my fortunes started to change. After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented. When the series had finished I was running the sales department at work, banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local. If you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to Poundland and pick up the DVD it's only 99p.","This show was an absolute waste of time. The characters were one-dimensional, the storyline was boring, and the humor was just not funny. I didn't feel any more confident after watching it; in fact, I felt like I wasted precious hours of my life that I'll never get back. Save your money and skip this one."
Was the movie able to effectively build suspense and deliver a satisfying payoff?,"five minutes after watching this i logged on to IMDb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie... genre:horror? it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself ""somethings gotta happen soon"" it did not...when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer/director i've never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i've gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works..<br /><br />i was taken in by the plot summary please don't make the same mistake.<br /><br />i gave this movie a 2 for the actors..they were not bad and it wasn't there fault they got such bad direction...","The movie failed to deliver any significant suspense or engaging moments, leaving the viewer constantly waiting for something to happen. The lackluster direction and poor execution by the writer/director led to a disappointing experience that left me feeling embarrassed for everyone involved in making the film. The plot summary may have been intriguing, but the actual movie did not live up to expectations. I would not recommend wasting your time on this sorry excuse for a horror flick."
Would you recommend this movie to someone looking for a thrilling and entertaining experience?,"as an inspiring director myself, this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is good acting decent, sound effects aren't too over the top. I would have give it a 7 for an indie film, but the story aren't that interesting. It's more on the drama side, character developments than a horror flick.<br /><br />It's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out, or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.<br /><br />honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's<br /><br />This movie is about a family who has a dry field, and that is just that.","While the technical aspects like editing and sound effects were decent, the movie lacks an engaging story and fails to deliver any sense of excitement or fear. It falls short in providing the audience with a thrilling or enjoyable experience, making it more suitable for those with a preference for slower-paced drama rather than a captivating horror film. The plot focusing on a family dealing with a dry field is uninteresting and offers little to keep viewers engaged."
What elements of the show did the viewer find lacking in humor and quality?,"I watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all. It might have been the first episode. Lately i realize ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station. All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down. I would say that I believe this show will be cancelled, but seeing as how ABC is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing, they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them.","The viewer found the show unfunny, the actors were perceived as bad, and the jokes and script were described as horrible, potentially leading to the show's cancellation. The viewer also stated that ABC is currently airing low-quality shows, which could mean that this average show might manage to stay on the network."
What characteristics of George Lopez's comedy style and show are criticized in the review?,"Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible.<br /><br />Nothing about Lopez has ever been funny. I have watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh.<br /><br />His stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body.<br /><br />I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />This guy has a grudge that won't end.<br /><br />I feel bad for Hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves.<br /><br />The shows plots are always cookie cutter with an Hispanic accent.<br /><br />Canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes.<br /><br />Might be why this show is always on at 2AM in replay.","The reviewer dislikes George Lopez's comedy, finding it unfunny, vindictive, and filled with animosity towards white people. They feel his jokes are cookie-cutter with an Hispanic accent and highlight the lack of diversity in representation on the show. The presence of canned laughter and unoriginal plots also contribute to the negative perception of Lopez's show."
What makes this show different from other family sitcoms?,"This show was absolutely terrible. For one George isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats. He also treats his mother with no respect. As a Hispanic, I am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />Plus the dysfunctional family thing's been done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times? I thought ABC would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air, but sadly, we're going to have to stomach this until they ""jump the shark"".<br /><br />In my opinion, they already did.","The show was absolutely terrible, George isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats. The portrayal of Hispanic characters is offensive and the dysfunctional family theme has been overdone. The lack of originality and disrespect towards family dynamics make this show a piece of garbage that should be taken off the air."
What are some of the drawbacks of the show that may disappoint viewers who start watching it?,"Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started watching the show I thought it was good. But the plots just got worse. The storyline were either too boring or predictable. George isn't always funny, he sometimes acts stupid. His jokes are overdone. His mom is the silliest character of the show. How can a mother treat her own son that way, okay if it was the daughter in law, but this was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny. The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job. Don't know how these shows get to play for so long. <br /><br />If you're really bored like I was and have nothing else to watch, I'd suggest you watch this.","The plots become worse as the show progresses, with boring and predictable storylines. The character of George is not consistently funny and his jokes are overdone. The portrayal of the mother character is deemed silly, raising questions about the unrealistic treatment of her son. Despite some initial humor, the show receives a low rating of 4/10 due to these shortcomings."
What elements of A Love Divided are criticized as manipulative and distorting history?,"I can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like ""we want to make sure they are playing for the right team"" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face. The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art. This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library.","The film is heavily criticized for its manipulative framing, biased portrayal of Irish Catholics as hegemonic, and Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden. The storyline is filled with stereotypes and outright vilification of Irish Catholics, leading to a distortion of the truth and a clear agenda. Any attempt at moral sway is seen as shallow, far from genuine art, making the film unsuitable for any legitimate film-watching or scholarly setting."
What did you think about the storyline and characters in the movie?,I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall. I remember that it really sucked. The plot had no sense. I hated the fox that became Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part and I don't want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end. I laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he had stayed dead. I think I even gave the video of this to somebody because I hated it. No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall. If you have a child don't let them watch this. They will probably agree with me that it sucks.,"The movie was poorly constructed with a nonsensical plot and annoying characters, particularly the fox that became Casper's friend. The emotional portrayal of Casper was unconvincing and overdone. The only redeeming quality was quickly undermined by the resurrection of the fox as a ghost, leaving the overall film feeling disappointing and not worth watching, especially for children."
Was the movie able to deliver a funny and engaging experience with its talented cast?,"This movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this film, I saw it for John Candy and assumed, incorrectly, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat, unfunny moments. And, to top it off, Candy delivered some of the crudest lines I had ever heard up to that time. So, despite a potentially funny cast and story idea, we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, though teens will probably find a few laughs. It's really a shame--it could have been so much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy it SHOULD have been wonderful.","This movie falls short of its potential with a weak plot, unfunny moments, and unnecessarily crude lines. Despite the promising cast, the humor falls flat, leaving viewers disappointed in the amateurish execution."
Do you think the casting decisions in this film were a major letdown?,"The major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of Macbeth. Hearing David Lansbury's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous ""Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow"" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role. I kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a bigger name was available. Then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast, misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations. Sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works)that they settle for less. This appears to be such an example.","The major issue with this film lies in the disbelief surrounding the selection of actors for the roles in a professional production of Macbeth. David Lansbury's portrayal of a key character fell short, making it hard to take him seriously in such a significant role. The overall casting and direction of the play within the movie felt more like a parody, with actors who seemed unable to grasp the essence of the characters they were playing. It seemed as though the rush to finish the film led to compromising on quality, resulting in a disappointing portrayal of the classic play."
What aspects of the movie disappointed viewers and made it feel like a departure from the usual Columbo style?,"I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that is the disturbing point, because Columbo is no ordinary detective.<br /><br />There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. First, I can't figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would've been ""The Vanishing Bride"" or something similar. Second, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it.<br /><br />I don't feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo.<br /><br />","The movie was criticized for being an unnecessary shift in format, resembling a generic detective drama rather than staying true to Columbo's unique and unorthodox style. Viewers found the title misleading and felt puzzled by Columbo's unexplained actions, leading to disappointment and a sense of betrayal from the usual beloved character portrayal."
Can you explain the plot of the movie in simple terms?,"Oh dear god. This was horrible. There is bad, then there was this. This movie makes no sense at all. It runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all. The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' isn't a real city, takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only writing that was decent was'Tilman' in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. It was actually a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout. Too bad. Hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the A List.","This movie was a disaster from start to finish. The storyline was completely nonsensical, jumping all over the place without making any sense. The attempt at creating a unique setting with a fictional city like 'Edison' just fell flat and made the whole experience even more unrealistic. As a Vancouver resident, the familiarity with the filming locations only made the film more cringe-worthy. The only saving grace was John Heard's portrayal of 'Tilman', which was overshadowed by the overall poor quality of the movie. The rest of the cast seemed over-the-top and the attempt at building tension and intrigue utterly failed."
What is your opinion on the casting choices in this movie?,"The movie itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable. What really gives me the creeps though is that people like Justin Timberlake even get cast for movies, and on top of that for movies like this one. I have to admit I had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the very instant he appeared I was just plain annoyed. The voice is crap, the face is a bad rip-off of Legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them. Said to say, I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I give this a 4. <br /><br />I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast... and cannot believe it.",
"What made this movie unbearable and disappointing to watch?
Negative","Pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying ""pussy"" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calling women ""pussy"" is just awkward... What the hell were the people behind this film thinking? Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable.<br /><br />I rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked.","The movie was absolutely pathetic and worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. The presence of acclaimed actors like Spacey and Freeman couldn't save it from its terrible script, awkward dialogue, and unbearable plot holes. The constant use of derogatory language by Morgan Freeman's character towards women made the viewing experience cringe-worthy. Overall, the film's horrid acting, confusing camera angles, and cheap background music combined to create an unbearable and disappointing movie."
What did you think about the overall performance of the actors in the movie?,"Timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen. It wasn't all bad, I just think the reporters role was wrong for him.<br /><br />LL Cool J played the typical rapper role, toughest,baddest guy around. I don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie, not even when proposed to his girlfriend.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman pretty much carried the whole movie. He was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey wasn't good or bad he was just ""there"".<br /><br />Overall it's a Dull movie. bad plot. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors.","The roles were simply not a good fit for some of the actors, making it a dull movie with bad acting and a weak plot. It's disappointing to see talented actors like Timberlake and Spacey not shine in their roles, with LL Cool J sticking to a stereotypical tough rapper character throughout. Despite Morgan Freeman's efforts, the film falls flat due to the mismatched casting choices and lackluster performances."
Why is the plot of the movie unrealistic and hard to believe?,"How can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up? With enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop.<br /><br />You will never get your 90ish minutes back. Life is too precious to rent this movie.<br /><br />I feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.<br /><br />If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. He does have a very major part in it, so fans might enjoy seeing him. <br /><br />However, I believe most of his fans are young girls, who may be turned off by the violence in this movie.","The movie features a storyline filled with unending corruption among cops that stretches believability. The inclusion of over-the-top weapons and lack of consequences for the corrupt cops make the plot hard to digest and leaves viewers feeling like they wasted their time watching. The presence of big-name actors in the film does little to salvage the poorly executed storyline. The only silver lining for Justin Timberlake fans is his significant role in the movie, but even that may not be enough to compensate for the excessive violence that may turn off younger audiences."
What makes 'Edison' a movie that viewers should avoid watching?,"The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie. He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad. <br /><br />Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /><br />Do not waste your time watching this film. Don't even bother downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice.<br /><br />And Justin, if you're reading this, stick to music. Even though you're no good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing.","Despite having a decent plot, 'Edison' is heavily criticized for Justin Timberlake's poor acting performance that ruins the entire film. According to viewers, Timberlake's acting is so bad that it negatively impacts every scene he is in, whether it be emotional, action-packed, or even silent moments. The portrayal by Timberlake has been described as one of the worst in cinematic history, leading many to suggest that viewers should skip this movie altogether. The overall sentiment is that Justin Timberlake should stick to music and leave acting behind."
Did the movie live up to expectations based on the setting of an open-air cinema under the Greek summer night?,"When you go at an open air cinema under the Greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is! Edison started really good with some good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be actors and a once again great Morgan Freeman but... (In a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience,done, a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action ,done, and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie...) when you see 30 elite police officers (packed with weapons that can demolish a building) shoot at a guy behind a car, fail to hit him even once while he kills all (but 3) and then the guy takes out a flame thrower (to kill the rest 3) ,you realise that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this!","While the movie started off well with some good performances from the actors and the always-great Morgan Freeman, it quickly turned into a boring and unrealistic mess. The action scenes were poorly executed, with elite police officers failing to hit a target and a character suddenly pulling out a flamethrower. It was hard to stay engaged in the movie with such unbelievable sequences happening."
Did the movie live up to the excitement and expectations of the audience?,"I don't want to go too far into detail, because I can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film, but I had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie. The animation is crud and the story alternates between boring/pointless to extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy, and the humor just did not work after being translated. It was a total chore to watch this movie, and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything - I wasn't expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel, but I was expecting something entertaining, and it simply didn't achieve this. Yaaawwnnn... Rent Kino's Journey instead.","The animation was poor, the story was boring and irritating, the humor failed to connect with the audience, and the attempt at slapstick comedy fell flat. It was a total chore to watch and failed to be entertaining."
What could have been improved in the movie to make it more engaging and less predictable?,"I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments. It's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre. Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters' behavior often strains belief. I'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/TV/literature/life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even). Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point. It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it doesn't really pay off.","The movie falls flat in its attempt to delve into deep human nature, coming across as simplistic and unoriginal. The characters' actions feel unbelievable, and the storyline lacks any real cinematic spark. Ultimately, it fails to deliver anything beyond a basic, unexciting narrative."
Was the movie Descent well-received by critics and audiences alike?,"The plot for Descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. And no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I saw.<br /><br />If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch ""Descent"", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.","The plot for Descent is incredibly lacking, with very few significant events throughout the movie. The majority of the film is filled with aimless scenes that fail to provide any engaging storyline. Even the presence of talented actress Rosario Dawson couldn't salvage the film from its lackluster plot. If you're looking for a movie with substance and a coherent narrative, Descent will leave you sorely disappointed."
What are the problematic elements in the movie's plot and portrayal of sensitive scenes?,"This movie sucked plain and simple. Okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped, and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is a douche, but the girl victim is partly to blame. I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist getting raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching.<br /><br />3.2/10","The movie showcases a disturbing and exploitative premise, with a problematic focus on rape as a form of revenge. The unequal treatment of the rape scenes, particularly emphasizing the male rapist's assault while minimizing the female victim's trauma, raises critical concerns about the film's intentions and impact. The narrative fails to provide depth or meaningful exploration of the subject matter, ultimately diminishing any potential value in watching the film."
Should films promote vigilantism as a solution to sexual assault?,"If you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this film is not the film that you want to watch. It was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her assailant. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. She in essence nullifies the judicial system. The film ""The Accused"" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. What the ""Descent"" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? Is victim any better that the accuser? No!!!","This film sends a dangerous message by depicting the victim resorting to vigilantism instead of seeking justice through the legal system. The portrayal of taking matters into one's own hands could potentially perpetuate harmful ideologies and deter survivors from seeking help through proper channels. It fails to address the complexities and repercussions of vigilantism, instead glamorizing it as a viable option for seeking revenge."
What are some major flaws in the film that contribute to its negative reception?,"Do not waste your time or your money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave). so, we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad. It was. I can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public. It was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. It went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick. And really not a good one. I went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him. Almost. All in all, an awful movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Don't waste your money. And don't let your kids watch it.","The movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. The storyline was confusing and disjointed, making it difficult to follow the plot. The characters were poorly developed, lacking depth and making it hard to empathize with any of them. The transition from a serious topic like assault to a gratuitous sexual content was completely inappropriate and distasteful. The film felt like a cheap attempt to shock the audience rather than create a meaningful narrative. Overall, a disgraceful and offensive movie that should never have been released to the public."
What did you find lacking in the movie?,"This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It doesn't succeed on ANY level. The acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. Complete garbage, I can't believe what a laughable movie this was. <br /><br />And I'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens. Pathetic.","This movie fails to deliver on any front. The acting is subpar and the plot drags along with an aimless, dull pace. The attempt to shock with a lengthy sex scene comes off as cringeworthy rather than provocative. Overall, this film is a laughable mess that fails to engage any audience. Additionally, the presence of Rosario Dawson in the film feels misguided, as the movie plays out like a boring teenage drama rather than the NC-17 indie hit it seemingly aimed to be."
What are some shortcomings of the movie Dead Letter Office?,"This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!<br /><br />The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will end up in the Dead Movie Office soon.","The movie starts off strong with humor and charm but quickly loses its momentum, becoming predictable and dragging on. The characters transition from being delightful to being one-dimensional caricatures, making the storyline feel stale and unoriginal. Additionally, the dialogue lacks freshness and fails to engage the audience, making the overall viewing experience disappointing. Moreover, the characters exhibit inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, further detracting from the film's credibility."
What aspects of the film's portrayal of the office of the film's title were disappointing and unrealistic?,"'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. Overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.","The film 'Dead Letter Office' fails to convincingly depict the workings of an actual postal office, lacking in authenticity and leaving viewers questioning the relevance of the setting. The poor acting and contrived connections between characters' pasts and presents further detract from the overall viewing experience, ultimately making it feel like a shallow and underdeveloped student film rather than a fully realized production."
What potential did the film fail to live up to?,"The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor. A visual treat to the eye, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued, at first, by the idea of Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion in order to ""find"" their capacity for love. What follows is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask. As a monk, Boyer held the formula for the monastery's liquer (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) -- when he leaves his ""marriage to god"" the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels Boyer was well rid of his past. However, the journey that follows is all too predictable.","While the visuals in the movie were stunning, the lack of depth in the storyline left much to be desired. The performances by the actors, especially Dietrich, fell short, with her character lacking emotional depth. The plot, which started off intriguingly, quickly became predictable, failing to engage the audience beyond the superficial aesthetics. Overall, the film was a disappointment as it failed to stimulate the mind and heart, relying heavily on visuals rather than substance."
Did the movie live up to its reputation as a classic sci-fi thriller?,"My first full Heston movie. The movie that everyone already knows the ending to. A ""Sci Fi Thriller"". The campy factor. Everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when I rented it, and on the morning that I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that I was in (Not wanting to move. Put in player, hide in blankets). And though I tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture, it just really didn't make it. Everything was all over the place, relationships had no backbone, the ending had no lead in. Everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to, because even though we all know that it's people, it's quick answers as to WHY it's people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window.","The movie was a disappointing mess with a disjointed plot, weak character relationships, and a rushed and unsatisfying ending. It failed to deliver any real depth or coherence, leaving viewers confused and underwhelmed."
What makes this movie lackluster and fail to captivate the audience?,"I saw this director's ""Woman On The Beach"" and could not understand the good to great reviews. This film is much like that one, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else. Like his other films, you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog, wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten, pretty uninteresting characters. If you feel you can like this film, don't let my review stop you. I do like minimalism in films, but I feel Tsai Ming-Liang's films are far superior. He has a fairly terrific actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IU liked it, but I don't. Oh, well.","The film is filled with vacuous dialogue and underwritten, uninteresting characters that make it hard for viewers to become engaged. The relationship between the two main characters lacks dynamics and fails to hold the interest of the audience. Compared to other minimalist films, this one falls short and lacks the depth needed to make it memorable."
What were your thoughts on the movie you recently watched?,"This movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description. But to me it was a bit of a let down. Very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening. It was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed (definitely not in sequential order). Also, nothing of any consequence was being filmed. I have viewed quite a few different Korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part, which is different from the typical Hollywood film. But this one befuddled me to no end. I viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me. I still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life, I guess he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.","This movie was an absolute letdown. It was incredibly slow, hard to follow, and felt like a jumbled mess of scenes thrown together randomly. The plot lacked depth and failed to offer any significant meaning or message. Even after watching it multiple times, I was left utterly confused and unsatisfied. Save yourself the time and skip this one."
What aspects of the film make it challenging to enjoy?,"This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ludicrous, the acting is over-the-top, and it looks cheesy. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as watching a train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacks the competency to execute either task well. Bollywood has produced far better films.","The script is absurd, the acting is exaggerated, and the visuals are tacky in this Bollywood movie that seems to have garnered praise from Western critics for unknown reasons. The director's incompetence is evident, overshadowing any redeeming qualities the film may possess."
What are some of the major drawbacks of this horror film?,"This was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares. For a horror or ""thriller"" film and hype, it's way too tame. There are only a few tense moments in here, not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre. Even those ""tense"" scenes weren't much. The music made them more dramatic that they actually were.<br /><br />There is a lot of symbolism in here, so the elitist critics label this ""a thinking person's horror film."" Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion I did - a waste of money at the video rental store.<br /><br />Summary: a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting. Vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised.","This horror film fails to deliver the expected intensity and horror elements. The story revolves around a young girl's nightmares but lacks sufficient scary moments. The few tense scenes present are not as gripping as they should be, with the music trying to compensate for the lack of real thrills. The film's attempts at symbolism fall flat, and it is labeled as a ""thinking person's horror film"" by some, but in reality, it is just a waste of time and money. The lead character is unlikable, and the acting is subpar, making it vastly overrated and not as advertised."
What elements of the movie created a lasting impact on the viewers?,"normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this movie got into my mind!!! it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective, it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout. Another seen was the family photo i wasn't expecting that and i jumped out my seat!!! i would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time!!!!!","The movie failed to offer any originality in terms of storyline, it heavily relied on jump scares and cliched horror tropes. The character development was weak, making it hard for the audience to connect or care about the characters on screen. The pacing was inconsistent, often dragging on without delivering any real suspense or tension. Overall, this movie felt more like a compilation of overused horror movie cliches rather than a fresh and innovative take on the genre."
"What are some of the criticisms of ""Paperhouse""?","I was rooting for this film as it's a remake of a 1970s children's TV series ""Escape into Night"" which, though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd, fascinating and disturbing. The acting in ""Paperhouse"" is wooden, unintentionally a joke. The overdubs didn't add tension they only reinforced that I was sat watching a botch. Casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth, chemistry or conviction. As in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted, consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible. Out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than I could have dreamt.<br /><br />""Escape into Night"" deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind.","The acting in ""Paperhouse"" is described as wooden and unintentionally comical. The dialogue is deemed dreary and lacking warmth, chemistry, and conviction. The film is criticized for its casting choices, lack of tension, and the unexpected and unsatisfying ending."
"What are some shortcomings of the movie ""Paperhouse""?","In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a ""thinking man's horror film."" Wow, you might say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (dubbed) accent, and a story with no chills, thrills or spills.<br /><br />It isn't even interesting psycho-babble. One will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of Leprechaun 5.<br /><br />The story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams. WHat you get isn't good horror, art house or even a decent after-school special. I found myself after the two hour point saying..where did my two hours go.<br /><br />The direction is uninspired and I wished it could even be pretentious...something interesting..it seems like the producers were on lithium.<br /><br />Even in the dream world things are boring.<br /><br />A short no on this one.","The movie ""Paperhouse"" falls short of being a captivating horror film, with its lackluster storyline, unconvincing performances, and unimpressive special effects. It fails to evoke any sense of fear or intrigue, leaving viewers feeling bored and unimpressed. The direction lacks creativity and the overall experience is underwhelming, making it a forgettable watch."
What are some of the major flaws in the movie 'Chances Are'?,"'Chances Are' a big mistake to see. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. But I guess I have to disillusion you. He made a really, really bad movie.<br /><br />According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other. Then appears Jr former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil.<br /><br />In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr's on his worst. He copies Michael J Fox.<br /><br />After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />Anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia.","The movie 'Chances Are' fails to deliver on entertainment with a confusing and poorly executed plot. The performances by the lead actors, including Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepherd, are lackluster and unconvincing. The attempt at humor falls flat, making the film dull and uninteresting. Overall, 'Chances Are' is best avoided if you're looking for a worthwhile movie experience."
What are some criticisms of the movie?,"Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically sick, the film is so annoying.....unless you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big-time. The ""re-cycling of souls,"" they call it here. Puh-leeze.<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as ""Heaven Can Wait."" It's also been done a lot better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.<br /><br />At least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise. That's about the only redeeming quality of this movie.","The film is annoying for those who don't believe in psychics or re-incarnation, with recycled themes that have been done better in other movies. The talented cast is wasted, and the only positive aspect is the lack of strong language."
What similarities did the reviewer mention between the movie and the Japanese film 'Ringu'?,"Oh dear. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of Japan's Ringu. Well, I guess the U.S. made their version of it as well, but at least it was an outright remake. So, so sad. I very much enjoy watching Filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country, so I can't believe this had to happen. Claudine and Kris are such big names there, surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism. To any aspiring movie makers out there in the Philippines: You do not have to stoop this low to make money. There are many movie buffs that are watching the movies Filipinos put out and enjoying them!",
What are some of the drawbacks of this movie?,"i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here. and... end.<br /><br />i really AVOID watching Pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies. why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting sucked, it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away.. SAYANG.","The reviewer criticized the lack of originality in the storyline of the Pinoy horror movie, highlighting the weak character development and storytelling. They also expressed disappointment in the movie's reliance on copying elements from other films, suggesting a creative exhaustion. Additionally, the reviewer mentioned issues with the flashback sequences and lighting, ultimately feeling that the movie did not deserve the positive reviews it received."
What features of the movie failed to captivate the audience's interest?,"So, I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film...<br /><br />The documentary section at the beginning dragged on. Yes, the kid is a nut-job from no where, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Seeing Sean Penn dressed as a ONJ is the only highlight... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.<br /><br />When Crispin Glover takes on Larry, the story-telling was better, but I just couldn't take anymore...","The documentary section at the beginning dragged on, and while the protagonist's uniqueness was emphasized, it wasn't engaging enough. The comedic highlight of Sean Penn dressed as Olivia Newton-John quickly lost its charm, and even the story-telling improvement with Crispin Glover's presence wasn't enough to maintain attention."
What makes this movie stand out on your list of worst movies ever?,"It's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all. It is by far the number 1 worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Not only have I ever been this bored before (luckily not for more then 1,5 hours), the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted. After the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. You hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and Trent Harris never lays his hands on a camera again...","The movie is incredibly boring and lacks any form of humor that could save it. With a nonexistent storyline that repeats itself multiple times, you are left hoping for it to end soon. It's a film that you wish had never been made, leaving you with a strong dislike for it."
What are the specific aspects that make this show unappealing to you?,"I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show","The acting is subpar, the plots lack creativity, the dialogue falls flat, the jokes are not funny, and the attempt to portray the '70s era feels forced and unconvincing. This show fails to capture the charm and nostalgia of other similar series like ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years""."
"Do you think ""That '70s Show"" effectively captures the essence of the 1970s?","I've tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called ""That '70s Show,"" I don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the '70s -- the decade in which I grew up. Of the episodes I have seen, most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period. Take away the novelty of (supposedly) being set in the '70s, and the show is neither interesting nor funny.<br /><br />If you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in America in the '70s, in my humble opinion you can do no better than ""The Wonder Years.""","The show fails to truly transport viewers to the 1970s, with plots and jokes that feel generic and could easily belong to any other time period."
Why does this show continue to receive high ratings despite its poor quality?,"Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /><br />Because it's so popular, I've tried more than once to watch it and I can't make it through an entire episode.<br /><br />For one thing, the acting is horrible. Everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch. They talk in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones, and have unnatural body language. I've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play.<br /><br />For another thing, it's NOT FUNNY. The plots are dull. They're not creative, intelligent, or FUNNY. Shouldn't a sitcom be funny?? Why am I not laughing?<br /><br />Lastly, what is seventies about this? It's about as authentic to the seventies as ""Happy Days"" was to the fifties.<br /><br />OH and what is up with Ashton Kutcher? Who cast this untalented dweeb? And now he's making movies?? Oh, save us all!<br /><br />If people think this is quality television, it worries me.","The show is simply unbearable to watch, with atrocious acting that feels like a parody of itself. The exaggerated performances are cringeworthy and lack any sort of authenticity. The humor falls flat, making the dull plots even more painful to sit through. The attempt to capture the spirit of the seventies comes off as forced and unconvincing. Ashton Kutcher's presence only adds to the disappointment, leaving viewers questioning his acting abilities. Overall, it's hard to understand the appeal of this sitcom to anyone looking for quality television."
What kind of reaction did this movie elicit from viewers?,"Here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase ""low budget"" a horrible name. Our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes ""molecular reorganization"". Students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s, right? Nope! It's not an example of high camp fun, which is way, WAY off the mark. A glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have had 99.44% more in the first place. Bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment at its best, aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies. Atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a Master's degree in film production! It's an automatic ""F"", so rest easy!","The movie is described as a low-budget disaster with absurd plot lines, gratuitous sexualization, and lacking in horror elements. It failed to capture the essence of B-movies and was deemed as atrocious bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment."
"What makes this movie so unbearable to watch?  
Negative","This movie is just plain bad. It isn't even worth watching to make fun of it. The lunatic professor is just plain annoying. Even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility (which I glady do for the sake of good bad movies) and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie, this movie asks for even more than that. If you are looking for women's locker room shower scenes, and random sexual encounters, get a porn, if you are looking for a good-bad movie, get something else. If you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie, rent this.","This movie is a complete disaster. From the irritating lunatic professor to the lack of substance in the storyline, it fails to deliver any entertainment value. The inclusion of unnecessary sexual content only adds to its overall cringe-worthy nature. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one."
"Was the lack of a coherent story a major drawback in ""The Invisible Maniac""?","Okay guys, we know why we watch film like ""The Invisible Maniac"" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A all over the place (with a lot more T than A). But...shouldn't there be a story to go with it?<br /><br />""C'mon,"" I can hear you say - ""this is just girls gettin' naked! Who needs a story??!""<br /><br />Well, if this were called ""The NAKED Maniacs"", I wouldn't have a problem. But since these guys are cribbing from ""The Invisible Man"", they need to have a bit of story hereabouts, you know, to keep your mind busy.<br /><br />However, all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when he cracks, uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers. And when you see the smarmy-looking teenagers he goes after, you'll be grateful.<br /><br />One star, for the T and A, but there's a little too much gore for you skin fans, so proceed with caution.<br /><br />TIDBIT - yes, it's THAT Savannah.","The movie fails to deliver a compelling storyline to accompany the excessive nudity and violence, leaving viewers unsatisfied with a disjointed plot that focuses more on gore than substance. The lack of depth in character development and narrative progression may disappoint audiences seeking more than just superficial entertainment."
What was disappointing about the movie despite the talented cast members?,"Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual. Ritter wasn't bad either. What's her name was as pretty as usual. It could have been a good movie. To bad the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite and boring.<br /><br />From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine. The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity.<br /><br />Finally, too bad the script writer wasn't the victim. Especially with the ""precocious"" lines from the child, which were completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Again, it's only the acting that prevented a much lower score.","The plot of the movie was atrocious, predictable, trite, and boring. The characters felt like stock pieces of cut-out cardboard, lacking any depth or originality. The script was weak with unbelievably ""precocious"" lines delivered by the child character. Overall, the lackluster writing overshadowed the decent acting performances, ultimately leading to a disappointing viewing experience."
What did you think about the casting choices in the movie?,"Undeveloped/unbelievable story line,(by the time I sort of figured out where it was going, I no longer cared) bad casting.(come on... William Macy as a hit man???) bad directing,(have you ever seen Tracey Ullman perform SO badly?)(Was I supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent, uncaring John Ritter character?) bad script...( Really, I'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful) the only Really good thing in it was the kid. Ten lines? It's not OK if your comment is less than ten lines? COme on-- whose rules are those? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines??? Isn't that kind of arbitrary? Why isn't it OK to have less than 10 lines of comment?","The casting in the movie was a major letdown, from William Macy as a hitman to Tracey Ullman's poor performance. The characters lacked believability and failed to engage the audience."
What makes this movie so entertaining despite its low-quality production value?,"My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is awful, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one.","This movie is a total disaster. The acting is cringeworthy, the camera-work is shaky, the story is nonsensical, and the costumes are laughably bad. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make anything decent. Watching this film feels like losing brain cells. I would not recommend this to anyone who values their time."
What were your thoughts on the acting and plot of the movie?<br />,"This movie is so awful, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so ridiculous.A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are boring and untalented, perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy Film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel ashame, because I paid for this lousy Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)","The acting in this movie was lackluster and the plot was ridiculous, making it hard to even watch. The actors seemed uninteresting and untalented, and the storyline was cheesy and poorly written. The only redeeming quality was the camera work capturing the National Forest scenes. It's a shame to have paid for such a lousy picture. Hopefully, no sequel or similar film is ever made with such a worse storyline."
What are some major flaws in the movie DEMONICUS?,"I mean really, how could Charles Band the head of Full Moon let a total stink-ball like DEMONICUS out. I mean it should never got the green light to begin with. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story on Tyranus other then he's a bad dude. Then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending. That's right a bad ending, Demonicus rises. The last survivor escapes a deadly cave in, then a picture of Chimera comes to life, cheaply I might add and chases her out. Then as she is walking home ala FUNHOUSE. A statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her. I mean, that makes no sense. What the hell was Charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made, with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies. They could have asked me, I had better ideas then DEMONICUS. THANKSGIVING TURKEY.","DEMONICUS was a complete disappointment, with a repetitive story, weak characters, and a lackluster plot development. The ending was particularly absurd and made no sense, leaving viewers bewildered and unsatisfied. The overall quality of the film was clearly lacking, making it a regretful watch for anyone seeking a coherent and engaging storyline."
What makes this movie particularly memorable and entertaining for viewers?,"okay, this movie f*ck in' rules. it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made. absolutely terrible, but you GOTTA see it. rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun, it's hilarious. and the behind-the-scenes featurette proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint. awesome. okay, rent it just for this one scene: two characters are actually WALKING IN PLACE for about 3 minutes in a shot. the director (on the commentary) says ""yeah, the tracking was so smooth it looks like they're..."". yeah, right man, they are totally walking in place. it's so funny.","This movie is an absolute disaster in terms of technical execution. The film is poorly made in almost every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting. The storyline is confusing and lacks coherence, making it difficult for audiences to stay engaged. The attempt at humor falls flat, and the overall viewing experience is more frustrating than enjoyable. You might find yourself questioning why you wasted your time watching this mess."
What made you feel like this movie was a waste of time and not worth watching?,"WARNING SPOILERS***** A really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in Italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls. One of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon. It's killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse.<br /><br />A waste of time for the viewers, as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on, the gore is ludicrous at best, and the acting is terrible, perfect pairing for such a bad script<br /><br />","This movie lacked a compelling storyline and failed to deliver any meaningful scares. The characters were poorly developed, the acting was subpar, and the gore scenes felt more comical than terrifying. The overall execution of the film fell flat, leaving viewers feeling disappointed and unsatisfied."
What is the main reason the film falls short according to the review?,"This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add, the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win), that is how far short this film falls. Now don't take this the wrong way, I love B-Movies, around half my collection is made of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is.<br /><br />First of the story (for a B-Movie) isn't that bad, it has potential there to make a B-Movie brand, were not talking Friday 13th potential, but potential none the less. But what really lets this film down is the acting, at not one second do I believe anything, it's like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier tan.<br /><br />In summary I'd like to say I've seen worse films, but I can't.","The film falls short mainly due to the lackluster acting that fails to make the audience believe in any moment, making it comparable to watching QVC with less believable presenters and lacking the charm of a typical B-Movie despite having some potential in the story."
What makes the scenes in this movie look amateurish and disappointing?,"I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time. She can act, but doesn't get a chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes. Must have come from a stock archive, because the movie is shot direct to videotape. The production values make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There's a really cheesy animated statue, but no other effects worth noting. This movie is bad, but not amusingly so. The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes.","The movie lacks production value, as evidenced by direct-to-videotape filming, stock archive shots, and poor quality effects. The result is a disappointing and amateurish presentation that falls short of professional standards."
What made this movie surprisingly enjoyable despite its low production values and cheesy costumes?,"Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.<br /><br />The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors. The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch. Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.<br /><br />In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting "" None Shall Pass"" and "" It's only a flesh wound, I've had worse"". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year.<br /><br />The ""gladiator/demon"" was a stitch too. Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.<br /><br />Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable. Kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film.<br /><br />",
What did you think overall about the chemistry between Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer in the 1945 film?,"Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film.<br /><br />There is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we deal with a supposedly bungling Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin.<br /><br />The real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls,"" Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-Franco group. She is quite a vicious character here;especially, when she throws a 14 year old child out the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.","The chemistry between Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer falls flat in this movie. It is evident that their connection on screen is lacking, which detracts from the overall viewing experience. Additionally, the storyline about the Axis obtaining coal is not well highlighted, leaving viewers feeling disconnected from the main plot. Instead, focus is placed on Boyer's clumsy character, which may not resonate well with audiences. Lastly, the attempt to portray Bacall as a British character is unconvincing, making her character feel out of place."
"What were some disappointing aspects of the movie ""Göta Kanal 2""?","(Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed)<br /><br />I saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them.<br /><br />As much as I loved to see Janne ""Loffe"" Karlsson on the big screen again, the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water, isn't original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that ain't, is just plain boring. I smiled like three times during the entire film.<br /><br />The placement of Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign saying; ""Findus made it happen!"".<br /><br />Göta Kanal 2 doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on DVD, just wait for it to air on TV, it wont take too long.","The movie failed to deliver on its potential, with a thin storyline, predictable jokes, and lack of originality. Despite the presence of beloved actors, the humor fell flat, resulting in limited entertainment value. The overemphasis on product placement added unintentional humor, highlighting the lack of depth in the film. Ultimately, ""Göta Kanal 2"" may be more suited for a TV viewing rather than a cinema or DVD experience."
What aspects did the reviewer feel were lacking in the movie that hindered their enjoyment?,"OK now, lets see. What was funny in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling into the water, silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max, no good. A whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons, no good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. Also, there are too may personalities they are following in this movie. This film should be about what is happening on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max. No good. All in all, I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts.","The reviewer mentioned that the overemphasis on funny accents, excessive fallings into water, and multiple personalities being followed detracted from the core focus of the film, which should have been the action on the water. They criticized the failed attempts at humor, the excessive sponsor exposure, and the lack of a cohesive balance between humor and the main storyline. The reviewer ultimately rated the movie a low four out of ten."
Do you think this film is worth watching?,"...for one of the worst Swedish movies ever...forgive me for being dull.<br /><br />First of all i haven't seen the first one (i was bored that's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one), well i hope the first one is better than this, it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes, For the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high (belive me so do i), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea, what's next ""Det sjunde inseglet II"". Sequels not based on novel or book doesn't turning out great to often, and this is a perfect example of one.<br /><br />OK i'm gonna be honest with you: i did laugh a bit, it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor. But don't buy it, rent it. Just let some other idiot do it or download it.<br /><br />4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already...","This movie is widely considered one of the worst Swedish films ever made. The plot is filled with weird cut scenes and strange changes, making it a confusing and unenjoyable viewing experience. The lack of connection to the first film also adds to the overall disappointment. While a few jokes may bring a chuckle, the overall quality is low, and it's recommended to avoid purchasing it. This film serves as a prime example of how sequels without source material often fall short."
What makes this Swedish movie one of the worst ever made?<br />,"This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made. <br /><br />It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006.<br /><br />I've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie. It shouldn't be that obvious. <br /><br />I can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this. If I had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before I saw the movie, it is gone for sure now. <br /><br />I've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and I can't understand how that is even possible.","The script was embarrassingly bad, filled with visible sponsored products, and featured known actors who should be ashamed to be associated with such a low-quality film."
What type of humor is predominant in the movie?,The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring. Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I like more intelligent humor.<br /><br />There were several known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script. Lena Endre was good looking as always.<br /><br />I don't remember the original movie so I can't say if it's better or worse.<br /><br />If you enjoy movies like Sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at.,"Despite having a straightforward and easy-to-follow storyline, the excessive use of no-brainer comedy made the movie boring for some viewers who prefer more intelligent humor. The performances of the known Swedish actors were only considered decent, and the film heavily relies on comedic elements similar to ""Sällskapsresan,"" which might not appeal to all audiences."
"Can you share your thoughts on the movie ""Return to the Shadows""? 

Negative","I wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on DVD and being sorely disapointed.<br /><br />I tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself (ie no budget, shot on digi cam), I stand by my original comments. This is a no budget student project (and not a particularly good one), released on video/dvd to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover). So deceving the public into thinking it's something it's not. I want my money back under the trades description act! Complete Rubbish!","I bought this movie on DVD and was really disappointed. I attempted to watch it again after reading some comments, but as a film student myself, I still hold my original opinion that this movie is a low-budget student project. The cover tries to portray it as an award-winning film, but it's far from it. Deceptive marketing at its finest. I feel like I wasted my money. Complete rubbish."
"Would you recommend watching this movie?
Negative","Yes, this movie make me feel real horror, when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho - Junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen . Believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie, i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting. I'm always supporting independent movies, when it deserves the support, but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies. I'm still traumatized. I will not trust in any nice cover anymore.","The movie's plot was stupid and the acting was extremely poor, making it a complete waste of time. The characters were unconvincing, especially the bald guy who came across as a psycho-junkie actor. The girl's performance was also subpar. Overall, I regret spending my time and money on this film and it has left me feeling disappointed and even traumatized. It's best to avoid this movie if you value your time and appreciate well-made independent films."
"What are some of the shortcomings of ""Stella Dallas"" according to this review?","1937's ""Stella Dallas"" with Barbara Stanwyck hasn't exactly aged well--how anyone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler. Perhaps they thought jaunty, cheerfully brash Bette Midler could make something out of it, but this hoary script defeats her. Plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock, and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life, can't escape tatty, old-fashioned trappings and sentiment. Midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses, but that fails to happen here; Stephen Collins is stolid as the man who changes her life, but Trini Alvarado is well-cast as Midler's daughter. This is what used to be referred to as a ""woman's picture"", a wallow, but it doesn't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930's origins. *1/2 from ****","The review criticizes the outdated storyline of the movie, suggesting that the attempt to modernize it with Bette Midler's performance falls flat. The script is described as old-fashioned and sentimental, making it difficult for the actors to elevate the film. Additionally, the lack of control over Midler's performance and the failure to update the narrative result in the movie feeling like a relic from the 1930s rather than a relevant piece of cinema."
"Do you think Eddie Murphy's stand-up comedy in ""Delirious"" is worth watching?","Eddie Murphy's ""Delirious"" is completely and totally rude, crude, crass and lude. This is indeed the only way to describe this appalling, trashy piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over. He does manage to be funny occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes.<br /><br />Forget it! Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie's foul style. I don't think I will bother with ""Eddie Murphy Raw"". I much prefer Eddie in the confines of a movie script.<br /><br />Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video","Eddie Murphy's stand-up in ""Delirious"" is disappointing, as he relies heavily on shock value, obscene language, and distasteful sex jokes rather than genuine humor. It feels trashy and crude, catering more to those who enjoy foul content rather than those seeking clever comedy. This performance may leave you questioning whether ""Eddie Murphy Raw"" is worth your time."
What are some aspects of the film that left a lot to be desired?,"This film is awful. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. The principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV, this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.","The film was incredibly predictable and felt like a generic, made-for-TV movie. The characters were one-dimensional, the storyline lacked depth, and the overall execution fell flat. It was like watching a cliche-filled, uninspired melodrama that offered no surprises or originality."
Was the pacing of the movie consistent throughout?,"Pedantic, overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Begins quite promisingly, with a still-relevant probe into an airplane explosion, however the melodrama involving James Stewart and wife Vera Miles just gets in the way (Miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress, and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule). Esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy helmed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the picture fails to make much of an impression. Best performance is turned in by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is. *1/2 from ****","The movie felt excessively long and was hindered by melodramatic elements that detracted from the overall plot. Vera Miles' portrayal as a tepid wife under duress was unconvincing, and the dialogue often came across as ridiculous. Despite the talent involved, the movie failed to leave a lasting impression and was not as engaging as it aimed to be."
Was this film an accurate portrayal of the F.B.I.'s history?,"This film is to the F.B.I.'s history as Knott's Berry Farm is to the old west. Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation fight against crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other kind?) shows throughout with teevee quality script-reading actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart at 20% of dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chewing the scenery, the film features every c-lister known in the mid-fifties with nary a hint of irony or humor, from the 'Amazon jungle' to the 'back yard barbecue', everything reeks of sound stages and back lots. Even the gunshots are canned and familiar. I imagine Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. Except for a few (very few) interesting exterior establishing shots, nothing here of note beyond a curio.","This film was a complete disappointment, offering a heavily sanitized and cheesy version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's fight against crime. From the subpar acting to the cheap sets and sound effects, everything about this movie screamed low-budget and lackluster effort. The overacting by Vera Miles and the uninspiring performance by Jimmy Stewart further contributed to the overall mess of the film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one."
What is the overall tone of the movie?,"This movie certainly proves, that also the good Americans can do terribly good propaganda. No questions being asked, no comments being made on power abuse or police terror, when James Stewart, solid and convincing as always, solves all the stories from Dillinger to 5th Column more or less singlehandedly. June Allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and E.J. Hoover is executive producer.And children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed, when the professionals execute. Not to speak of civil rights, which are never broken or homes, which are never intruded. And if the FBI service would not be enough, Steward also gives his son's life for the country in WW II. Perfectly made, if you wouldn't know better....","The movie is criticized for presenting a highly sanitized and propagandistic view of American law enforcement and patriotism, with little to no exploration of power abuse, police terror, and other darker aspects of the FBI's history. The simplistic portrayal of James Stewart's character as a flawless hero who singlehandedly solves all problems without any moral ambiguity or consequences is seen as unrealistic and lacking depth. The movie's portrayal of family values and patriotism is also viewed as overly idealized and failing to reflect the complexities and nuances of real-life situations."
"Can you describe the movie ""Ninja Mission""?","Even 20+ years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I ever managed to sit through. Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene, fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine guns with wild abandon, and then silently leave. Wow, how will we find those silent invisible assassins? Just follow the shell casings and smoke!Painfully bad dialog (or was it brilliant and just poorly translated?), not an Asian in sight in the cast, and a whopping total of 3 Asians among the stunt crew. The plot is ridiculous, the acting pretty much non-existent - then again, ninja can't act! Save yourselves - avoid watching at all costs!","Ninja Mission is a complete disaster, with laughably bad dialogue, a nonsensical plot, and almost no Asian representation in both the cast and stunt crew. The so-called ninjas are anything but stealthy, firing their loud guns without a care in the world, leaving behind obvious traces for anyone to follow. Skip this one if you value your time and sanity."
What were some shortcomings of the movie 'Husbands'?,"Having low expectations going in, the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'Husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. I won't say the new footage was grade A material, but it provided a very solid foundation for what ""could have been"" a good all-original film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a time of one day shooting schedules. After the new footage, Jules White decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' into this short, making for a not-so-smooth story transition, which Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end, giving us the old, worn-out ending of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) getting shot in the butt.<br /><br />3/10","The movie 'Husbands' incorporated stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' which resulted in a jarring story transition and an unsatisfactory ending. The attempt to blend old footage with new footage fell short, leading to a lackluster viewing experience."
What makes this particular movie difficult to sit through and not very entertaining?,"Scary, but mostly in the sense that will it be over before I turn 70. I saw this as a late night re-run in about 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just).<br /><br />Ray Milland is a little scary because he looks as if he's been stuffed by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux looks as if she's smoked up all the Beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /><br />It's a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. This is one turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on Saturday morning and there's nothing on but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then I guess it beats that. But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.","This movie is dreadfully slow-paced, dragging on to the point of inducing boredom. The performances are lacklustre, with Ray Milland's stiff portrayal and Yvette Mimeux's unconvincing acting. The plot feels like a poorly executed attempt to imitate a famous horror film, resulting in a lack of originality and excitement. Overall, this movie is a tedious and uninspired piece of cinema that fails to engage or entertain its audience."
Can you share a negative review of the movie?,"Please note that I haven't seen the film since I discovered it in 2007, and my town is smaller and doesn't carry it. However, I really want to say something about it. I'm actually doing research for university on the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different!!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license granted, the real Dr. Bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women, and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film. I think it's laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis! The only actual fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please don't waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry.","The film completely distorts the historical reality of its main character, Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke, glorifying him despite his endorsement of disturbing practices like hysterectomies to cure insanity in women. The movie's portrayal is laughable, with little regard for the real horror experienced by women under Dr. Bucke's care. It's best to avoid wasting time on such a misleading and disrespectful film."
What made this film particularly challenging to watch in the opinion of the reviewer?,"I tried twice to get through this film, succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a great DVD transfer. The problem? It's simply too boring.<br /><br />If you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene, which takes up most of the second half of the film, you have it made, but it's tough getting to that point. There are some interesting talks by ""Abraham Lincoln"" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The ending is touching as Lincoln walks off and they superimpose his Memoral statue over the screen.<br /><br />It's a nice story, well-acted and such....but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there. I suspect the real Abe Lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film.","The film was criticized for being boring and lacking excitement, especially in the first half, which made it difficult for viewers to stay engaged. The slow pace deterred the audience from fully enjoying the story, despite the well-acted scenes and touching moments later on."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""Young Mr. Lincoln""?","Every movie from the thirties is dated, but if you were to watch only John Ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others. i.e. Grand Hotel is comparatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there's always the hard-sell of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the over-emphasis of some heavy's badness. Always the poorly crafted, awkward and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment. And sentiment is all this has going for it.<br /><br />What Ford does here doesn't make me appreciative of Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the States were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here. Ford went on to make decent movies. This is too dated to be anything but bad. It feels entirely false. <br /><br />Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And no one from Illinois would pronounce the trailing 'S,' or say ""Shonuff!""","The movie fails to resonate with the audience due to its dated portrayal of characters and overly sentimental script. The emphasis on nobility and villainy comes across as heavy-handed and the overall execution feels forced and artificial. The depiction of the characters as complete morons is unconvincing and off-putting. Furthermore, the portrayal of historical figures like Lincoln with exaggerated features like a fake nose adds a bizarre element that detracts from the authenticity of the film. The pronunciation inconsistencies also create a lack of believability in the characters. Overall, ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" falls short in delivering a compelling and genuine portrayal of its story."
Was the character development of Esther Kahn effective in portraying her transformation from a shy woman to a successful actress?,"The point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this Star is Born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime. Summer Phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment. Even in the lengthy scenes of Esther's acting lessons, we never see her carry out the teacher's instructions. After suffering through Esther's (largely self-inflicted) pain in excruciating detail, we are given no persuasive sense of her triumph.<br /><br />The obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. Yet the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never come together in a coherent whole. A 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go before an audience.","The character development in ""Esther Kahn"" falls short in convincingly showcasing Esther's journey towards success. While Summer Phoenix delivers a commendable performance as a introverted young woman, her portrayal lacks credibility when transitioning into a renowned stage actress. The film's focus on Esther's struggles and pain feels exaggerated and fails to translate into a compelling triumph for the character. The various issues plaguing Esther's life are not effectively intertwined to create a coherent storyline, resulting in a disjointed and unresolved narrative. Ultimately, the film's prolonged duration does little to resolve the inconsistencies in Esther's characterization, leaving the audience unsatisfied with the lack of a cohesive and impactful conclusion."
"** Based on the positive reviews, what made Esther Kahn's plot too contrived and poorly executed?

**","A shame that even a talented director, Desplechin, could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly-talented actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot. In an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's plight, the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer. In an overly long running time, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display. The content is incoherent and gratuitous as Phoenix struggles to carry out Desplechin's instruction, just as Esther is supposedly trying to do the same. Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel a victory in Phoenix's talent.","** The movie Esther Kahn failed to resonate with viewers as the plot appeared overly contrived and poorly executed. The performance of the lead actress, Phoenix, fell flat in conveying the struggles of the character and failed to evoke any compassion from the audience. The storyline was dragged out and melodramatic, leaving viewers disconnected from Esther's supposed journey. Desplechin's direction seemed to be lacking, not bringing out the best in Phoenix's acting talent and ultimately leading to a disappointing and unconvincing portrayal of Esther Kahn."
What were the major flaws in the character development of the heroine in the movie?,"This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure drivel. How anyone could develop a connection with the heroine, or have empathy for her, is beyond me. I felt I was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder. Just terrible.<br /><br />In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt at producing and ""art"" film - except I could not, for the life of me, find any art in it at all.<br /><br />If this woman had lived in todays' world, she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti-psychotic medications. That, or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman. Why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her - and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress - speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort.","This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen.

"What are some issues with the movie ""Eh"" as pointed out by a viewer who found the plot weak and the acting just okay?","I went to school with Jeremy Earl, that is how I heard of this movie, I don't really know if it was in the theater's at all. I don't recall the name. I have seen it, it is like one of those after school specials. The acting is OK, not great. The plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny. So the only comment I can give this movie is ""Eh"" I borrowed the movie from Jeremy, if I was in a movie rental place, this is one that I would walk past and after watching it I wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age. I've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed, the slang is overused or just outdated. Many times I think thats what makes their characters unbelievable.","The viewer mentioned that the movie felt like an after-school special with mediocre acting, a weak plot, and corny lines. The portrayal of urban kids was criticized for overused or outdated slang, making the characters unbelievable. Overall, the viewer found the movie unimpressive and not recommended for anyone past middle school age."
What elements of the movie failed to impress the reviewer?,"The opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate, well-crafted independent film. Damn that opening shot for filling me hope. As the ""film"" progressed in a slow, plodding manner, my thoughts were varied in relation to this ""film"": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this ""film""? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this film in the Theatre! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a Movie Theatre, because at home you can TURN IT OFF. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college ""nerd"" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Other than that this ""film"" went from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter. It succeeded on none of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.","The film failed to deliver on its promise hinted at by its strong opening shot. The progression of the movie was slow and plodding, leaving the audience questioning the quality of the actors and even contemplating leaving the theatre. The attempt to blend comedy, family drama, and spiritual uplifting fell flat, and the performance of the girlfriend was particularly singled out as lacking."
What are some flaws in the Dutch thriller movie?,"Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a news stand, and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station. And he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many) but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism, and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas.","The movie is criticized for having a nonsensical plot dragged out for almost two hours, with a pointless conclusion. The main character, Krabbe, is portrayed as a gay alcoholic writer with inconsistent behavior, and the film is said to rely heavily on visual flair and graphic scenes instead of coherent storytelling."
What sets this movie apart from other horror films and makes it a must-watch for the horror enthusiasts?,"I was really horrified by this eerie movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start sweating, and feeling uncomfortable, for you start fearing the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare, and what's worse-it all comes out. For one hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence, and most of all: your wallet, since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all.","The movie fails to deliver a coherent plotline and relies heavily on cheap jump scares and gore to compensate for the lack of a gripping storyline. The characters lack depth and development, making it hard for the audience to emotionally connect with them. Additionally, the cinematography feels amateurish and the special effects are unimpressive, further diminishing the overall viewing experience. Nuit Noire may promise an eerie atmosphere and a creepy musical score, but it ultimately falls short in delivering a truly terrifying and satisfying horror experience."
Can you shed some light on the meaning behind the darkness in the movie?,"I don't know what this movie is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always darkness except for seconds a day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason. What little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges. I have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. But I wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else.","This movie seems like a confusing jumble of random scenes with no coherent storyline. The bizarre events that unfold lack any real purpose or explanation, leaving viewers feeling lost and frustrated. The seemingly nonsensical dialogue and strange occurrences only serve to further confuse and alienate the audience. It's a film that fails to engage and instead comes across as a pretentious and aimless experiment that ultimately leaves viewers scratching their heads in bewilderment."
What are some shortcomings of the movie?,"We saw this on the shelf at the local video store, saw ""Coppola"" in the credits and got excited. That was the one and only time this movie raised any interest. I could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably, or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably. In general, the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish. The sound in particular was absolutely dreadful, especially in the scenes shot in the little bar; the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable. Very disappointing.","The movie was a major letdown with unclear intentions whether it aimed to be humorous or serious. The production quality appeared amateurish, with dreadful sound throughout, particularly noticeable in the scenes shot in the bar. The corny dialogue further added to the disappointment, making it difficult to enjoy the film."
What makes this movie fall short in delivering an engaging Western experience?,"In this day and age of incredible special movie effects, this one was a sore disappointment. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired, as was the dialogue. Westerns are not common fare for Hollywood so much these days, but movies like ""Silverado"" prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one. Considering that, it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing, much less creating such a weak film as this one. If you love and are looking for a good western, keep looking!","This movie fails to captivate the audience with lackluster performances and uninspired dialogue, making it a disappointing watch for fans of Western films. Compared to well-made Westerns like ""Silverado,"" this movie pales in comparison and struggles to hold the viewer's attention. It may not be worth the effort or expense to watch a film that doesn't live up to the standards of the genre."
What were your overall thoughts on the movie Western Showdown?,"I enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit. The script and dialogue is laughable. The acting was awful, where did they get them from? Music was OK i have to say. Luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of.<br /><br />I was geared up at the beginning when the stranger (martin sheen) started to tell his story. I have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong shot Tex's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league. But thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter. I had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better, never did.","Although there were some elements that intrigued me at the start, such as the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, the movie ultimately falls flat due to its laughable script, poor acting, and lackluster quality. I was left disappointed and felt it did not deliver on its potential."
What made this western movie fail to impress the audience?,"The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately that is all the positive I can say about this western movie. I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western. I am not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a spoof. The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. Not realistic at all. A lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. A previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at President Bush. This was not a democratic or republican western. It was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially. I wonder if it made any money. At times I thought I was watching a movie made by college movie students. If that was the case, then it was a great movie.","The western movie failed to impress the audience due to its lack of realism in characters, particularly the hero and villain who came off as too plastic. Additionally, the shooting scenes were poorly executed, making them seem more like a joke than an intense action sequence. The overall quality of the movie was lacking, with some viewers even questioning if it was meant to be a tribute or a spoof of classic western films. The film did not align with any particular political stance but was simply deemed as a bad attempt at a commercially successful western movie. The authenticity portrayed by some supporting actors was overshadowed by the overall disappointment in the storytelling and execution of the film."
What were some confusing aspects of the film?,"One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and I decided it was pretty lame. That was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse. I was pretty mystified by the whole Hopalong Cassidy/Great Bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all. Obviously, the name Coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed.<br /><br />If you make it to the end of the film, you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions I did. What exactly was the hook with the gloves? What's up with the rodeo scenario? Who was The Stranger supposed to represent? Why did they make this film? <br /><br />I could probably go on but my energy's been drained. Look, there's already a Western called ""The Gunfighter"" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. That one I can recommend.","The film felt pretty lame by the one-hour mark, with confusing elements like the Hopalong Cassidy/Great Bar 20 gimmick that didn't add to the story. The involvement of Coppola's name didn't guarantee success, leaving viewers scratching their heads about the significance of the gloves, rodeo scenario, and The Stranger character. By the end, you'll likely wonder why this film was even made, as its lack of clarity and purpose drained the energy of the viewer. A better option might be to watch the 1950 Western ""The Gunfighter"" with Gregory Peck, which would leave you feeling much better than this one."
What are some specific aspects of the movie that made it feel dreary and pointless?,"A dreary and pointless bit of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Badly scripted, with inane and wooden dialogue. You do not care if the characters (indeed, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little point to the whole thing. Perhaps some of the set and setting will interest--those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived. The framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting, and the Hoppalong Cassidy character himself is both boring and inept.",
What left the reviewer disappointed with the film's storyline and character development?,"I read the back of the box and it talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, ""wonderful! This will be great!"" I was so wrong. The story was all screwed up. In fact I still don't get it. It just seems to me that all the characters did was drink, smoke (opium?) and have sex. Not that those aren't good movie qualities, but please! Where was the story? I made myself finish the movie, and yes, it did pick up towards the end, but by then the movie was almost over. Rent it if you really want to. Just don't trust the back of the box.","The movie failed to deliver a coherent storyline and meaningful character development, leaving the viewer feeling confused and unsatisfied. It largely focused on characters drinking, smoking, and engaging in sexual activities, lacking a compelling narrative to tie it all together. The initial promise of exploring the lives of Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron was not fulfilled, leading to a lackluster viewing experience."
What makes this movie a disappointing watch for viewers?,"Don't waste your time on this dreck. As portrayed, the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture. ""Gothic"" was entertainment at least, this is crap. If you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other, this may be right up your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk, and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering. Mary Shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever, but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter, but didn't catch the title. I was hoping this was it, but no such luck. Not recommended.","The characters lack redeeming qualities and their interactions are seen as unbearable. The portrayal of Lord Byron as unlikable and the lack of respect for Mary Shelley further contribute to the disappointment. The film is considered pretentious, with viewers advised to watch ""Gothic"" instead."
"What were your thoughts on the film ""In Our Shoes""?","As a young black/latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I didn't. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a film like ""Raising Victor"" over this one any day. I just was not too impressed.","As a young black/latina woman, I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me.

What are some flaws in the movie Tigerland?,"I was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of Tigerland. It was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be. The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things Colin Farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers.<br /><br />I kept thinking, ""Hey, there's a reason why boot camp is tough. It's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit. There's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders."" I was rooting for Bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers. I would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit.<br /><br />--<br /><br />","The plot of Tigerland is ridiculously unbelievable and unrealistic, presenting a liberal's idealistic view of the military. The dialogue is hard to believe, as well as the actions Colin Farrell's character gets away with. The portrayal of boot camp lacks the toughness necessary to prepare soldiers for battle, and the focus on emotions rather than duty is concerning for anyone wanting to see a realistic military film."
What were some aspects of the film that the reviewer found unrealistic and problematic?,"While some scenes of training were realistic, too many of them depicted military instructors as ex-Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the screen play were either anti-military types or writing a film for that audience.<br /><br />I am a Viet Nam vet and, even during this period, military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison.<br /><br />And I really loved the scene where the ""hero"" and his buddy (both privates) are sitting down in the Captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the Captain as if he were their buddy. This sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose for the scene.<br /><br />At the end I asked myself, ""What was this film about?"" as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except ""I hate all authority."" Thank God I got it from the library and did not pay to rent it.","The reviewer was highly critical of the portrayal of military instructors as ex-Nazi types, noting that it was unrealistic and suggested a bias against the military. They also found the interactions between the 'hero' and his buddy with the Captain to be far-fetched and not reflective of real military dynamics. Additionally, the reviewer felt that the film lacked a clear focus and ultimately seemed to convey a message of ""hating all authority."""
"Did you enjoy the humor and premise of the movie?
Negative","Hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day, you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot, though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well (what is he doing still making these movies anyway? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie?). It was a pretty fun premise -- a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon -- but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length, and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or, Abbott and Costello if that's your thing) -- basically just bad puns. Still, I found this movie fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons. Good job, but still a fundamentally flimsy production.","The movie's attempt at humor falls flat with cheesy and outdated jokes that feel like they are from a different era. The storyline lacks depth and the overall production feels cheap and poorly executed, making it hard to fully enjoy the film."
What aspects of the film's plot were lacking and what made the overall storyline uninteresting?,"this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.","The film lacked a cohesive plot, with 90% of the scenes having no meaningful storyline. The actors seemed disinterested, and the attempt at creating a noir thriller failed miserably with incoherent and laughable sequences. The film's reliance on cliches like constant rain and unnecessary closeups on the main character only served to distance the audience further. This adaptation of a John Grisham manuscript fell short of capturing the suspense and engaging storyline of his other book-to-film adaptations."
What makes this film such a disappointment to audiences and critics alike?,"Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film. What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings. Actors of stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap, lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless, bilious rant. I won't, but only because I no longer want to occupy my ""mind"" with this trash.",
What were some aspects of the movie that led to a disappointment for viewers?,"I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors, and the director, even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case, it was a big miss. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like ""Dead Again"", I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, even though his best performance was not ""Tender Mercies"", but ""The Great Santini"". This movie was truly a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10.","Despite the anticipation due to a talented cast and an acclaimed director like Robert Altman, this particular film turned out to be a major letdown. Altman's attempt at building suspense fell flat, leaving viewers unengaged. The performances, especially from actors like Kenneth Branagh and Robert Duvall, failed to elevate the weak storyline. Overall, the movie was considered a waste of time by many, receiving a low rating of 2 out of 10."
"What is your opinion on the movie ""The Return""?","This movie is like real life, by which I mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the ""experimental"" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /><br />A big bore. No big surprise that Altman helms this - he is a very variable performer (yes we all loved ""Gosford Park"", but ""Pret A Porter"" anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film. And no, it is not ""so bad it's good"".<br /><br />It's just bad.","The movie was a big bore, with not much happening in the 2-hour duration, and the plot was hard to follow due to the invisible cast and experimental lighting. The director's past performances were erratic, and even though it was based on a John Grisham tale with an excellent cast, the film turned out to be a masterpiece of bad cinema."
Who is the most unsympathetic character in the movie and why?,"There is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie. Is it the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh that we're supposed to be pulling for? Well, let's see -- we learn he's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities. He treats his coworkers like cattle, gets them involved in his own personal crisis (in the process, getting one of them killed), jeopardizes the safety of his kids, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, tries to strong-arm the police and school administrators -- and all this for what? Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD! I was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp...it would have made for a far more satisfying ending.","The character of the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh is depicted as a sleazebag defense attorney who shows little regard for others, jeopardizes the safety of his family, and engages in unethical practices. His actions throughout the movie leave the audience disliking him and rooting for his downfall."
Is the film worth watching?,"How a director of Altman's experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with, or to care about what happens to, a lead character who is neurotic, a whiner, a jerk with no redeeming qualities -- that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work. A monstrous piece of trash. In addition to this crippling flaw, the plot line requires serious concentration to follow. The setup that the Branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience. This latter issue is at the core of the film: it represents directorial self-indulgence with profound contempt for the taste, values, and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman.<br /><br />Patrick Watson","The film is a confusing piece of work with a lead character who has no redeeming qualities, making it hard for the audience to connect or care about him. The plot is difficult to follow and feels like the writer and director have lost respect for the audience. Overall, it comes off as a self-indulgent and contemptuous film that lacks appeal."
What was the most disappointing aspect of the movie for some viewers?,"I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. He is a fine actor by most accounts, but he simply could not pull off the Southern accent. I mean, it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why U.S. actors were not cast in this film. I second that notion. It's wonderful when actors/actresses wish to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained. Maybe it was Altman, but he's a such a great director...<br /><br />Well, I really don't want to bash Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much. Everybody deserves to screw up here and there. But it is hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through The Gingerbread Man.","Some viewers found Branagh's attempt at a Southern accent in the movie to be deplorable and distracting, leading to a strained and annoying performance. They felt that a U.S. actor should have been cast instead to avoid such a jarring portrayal."
"What drives the plot in the movie, and how does Rick's encounter with Mallory lead to unforeseen consequences?","Divorced lawyer Rick Magruder (Branagh) stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss (Davidtz), who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car. Rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there, seemingly by her father, Dixon Doss (Duvall). Rick and Mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when Mallory carelessly undresses in front of Rick, and he then spends the night with her.<br /><br />Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory encounters him later in the day, asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior. Rick, now obsessed with Mallory and willing to do anything for her, is successful in having Dixon put on trial and sent to prison, but when he is freed by his local friends, Rick finds himself in a trouble, trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life.","The movie features a complex storyline that keeps the audience engaged as divorced lawyer Rick Magruder's chance meeting with Mallory leads to unexpected twists and turns. Branagh and Davidtz deliver captivating performances that bring depth to their characters, making the viewer emotionally invested in their journey. The film expertly weaves together elements of suspense, obsession, and danger, culminating in a thrilling climax that leaves a lasting impact."
What are some elements that detract from the overall quality of the film?,"Have you ever heard the saying that people ""telegraph their intentions?"" Well in this movie, the characters' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have.<br /><br />The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque ""Southern"" accents employed by British actors.","The movie suffers from an obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque ""Southern"" accents used by British actors. The characters lack charisma and depth, with Embeth Davidtz's performance coming across as wooden and Kenneth Branagh failing to convey the brash charm needed for his role. The setting could have been utilized better to enhance the story, but instead, the actions of the characters feel forced and unconvincing."
"What made this film disappointing despite having a top-notch cast and director, good locations, and a nice atmosphere?","I should never have started this film, and stopped watching after 3/4's. I missed the really botched ending. This film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. It had nice atmosphere, a top notch cast and director, good locations. But a baaaaaad story line, a bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent--it was better than the script. The plot was stupid--driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways. No one behaves like this outside of Hollywood scripts.","The movie was a letdown due to a terrible storyline and a poorly written script. The plot seemed unrealistic as the characters' actions were not believable, making it hard for the audience to remain engaged. The film's ending was particularly botched, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and ultimately regretful of investing their time in watching it."
Were you disappointed by The Gingerbread Man?,"I can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! The Gingerbread Man starts of on the right foot, and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending. But at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time on. It's just so unbelievably how the bewitched Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh's character around by his nose. The movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer, which has been left out in the sun too long. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham-movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie. Don't waste your time here!","The Gingerbread Man starts off promising but quickly descends into a disappointing mess. The story becomes nonsensical, the characters' actions are unbelievable, and the climax falls completely flat. Despite the talented cast, the movie fails to deliver and ends up being a waste of time."
What disappointments did you encounter while watching the movie?,"I have seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this film is so awful, so BORING, that I got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest. A pity. Boasting talent such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a big-time lawyer who has a one-night fling with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged her cat, etc, etc, so Branagh has him sent to a nuthouse, and he promptly escapes. Somehow (I couldn't figure out how) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary. I wanted to like this, and, being a huge Grisham fan, have read all about this movie and I (foolishly) expected something interesting. This is honestly the WORST film I've seen to date and I wish I could have my money refunded. * out of *****.","The movie was so awful and boring that I couldn't even finish watching it. Despite having talented actors and a story by John Grisham, the pacing was extremely slow and the plot was confusing. It was honestly the worst film I've seen so far, and I regret spending money on it."
What makes this movie stand out from other comedy-dramas?,"I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy-drama, but I didn't. It stars Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who's married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third. It all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful. The film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and I thought it needed to be the other way around.",I personally found the pacing of this movie to be sluggish and the handling of its comedic and dramatic elements to be unbalanced. The storyline could have been more compelling if the emphasis was on drama rather than comedy.
What were the main issues with the film according to this review?,"Based upon the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologized to them--all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end. Half the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes of Paris--for example, I was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I couldn't really recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything, or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual films, don't miss this. If you are down to earth like me, you will be sorry you saw it.","The film was described as bizarre, lacking in entertainment value, and mainly consisting of scenes inside a bar with minimal showcasing of Paris. The reviewer also noted that no one in the theater reacted positively to the movie, indicating a lack of humor or engagement."
Did this movie successfully convey the message of love to the audience?,"be warned: this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence.<br /><br />The only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways.<br /><br />Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot. Just an sketchy idea of a plot. The writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer. However, that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these ""jokes"" were just silly.<br /><br />This is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I don't know and I don't care.","Unfortunately, this movie falls short of delivering a coherent message about love due to its disjointed storytelling. The film attempts to showcase numerous love stories in a short span of time, resulting in underdeveloped characters and a lack of meaningful plot. The attempted twists and surprises within each story come off as forced and fail to engage the audience emotionally. Overall, this film misses the mark in delivering a heartfelt depiction of love."
"What are some issues with the movie ""Paris Je T'Aime""?","The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in one movie is great. But.... too many stories, too short and lacking really any sense. No connection between the scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories... but these were out of 18. The frame reminded me of ""All the invisible children"" - a movie which I liked a lot. Compared to it, however, ""Paris Je T'Aime"" lacks the intriguing short story, which develops - starts and has its end. And it lacks the topic connecting all those - children. I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together.Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it...","The film has too many disconnected short stories, making it lack coherence and a unifying theme. Only a few of the 18 stories were deemed brilliant, with the rest feeling disjointed and lacking depth. The comparison to ""All the Invisible Children"" highlighted the shortcomings of ""Paris Je T'Aime"". Additionally, the film's focus on Paris alone may not be engaging for viewers unfamiliar with the city. Overall, it might not be recommended for those seeking a more cohesive and impactful storytelling experience."
What elements of the movie made it difficult to sit through?,"Ouch! This one was a bit painful to sit through. It has a cute and amusing premise, but it all goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned in surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played it way over the top. I know that's the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame actors, when the script and director have them do such schlock. If you're going to have outrageous characters, that's OK, but you gotta have good material to make it work. It didn't here. Run away screaming from this movie if at all possible.","The movie has an appealing idea but fails to deliver on it. The main actor, Matthew Modine, gives a bland and irritating performance. While Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville manage to impress with their acting, Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly are way too over-the-top. The script and direction push the actors into doing ridiculous things, causing the movie to fall apart. The film tries to be outrageous but lacks the substance to back it up. It is best to avoid this movie if you can."
Was the movie able to effectively engage the audience with its storyline and characters?,"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""Ordinary People""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of ""The Natural"". Too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****","While the film had a promising premise of a rural family drama exploring the aftermath of a tragic incident, it ultimately fell short in execution. The director's gloomy approach and the lackluster portrayal of the adult characters made the movie seem dull and uninteresting. Despite having talented actors like Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley, the film failed to capture the audience's attention and failed to deliver a compelling and memorable viewing experience."
What elements of this movie received mixed reviews from viewers?,"This movie has a very Broadway feel - the backdrop, the acting, the 'noise'- and yet that's all it has. Some 'sense' of a Broadway without the bang. <br /><br />The movie is slow-paced, the picture disjointed, the singing 'pops up' on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical. <br /><br />Disappointing: Sinatra <br /><br />Intolerable: Sinatra's fiancé---surely, the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary. <br /><br />Tolerable: Mr ""i remember the numbers on my dice"" <br /><br />Delight: Brando's understated singing (very biased!)<br /><br />Surprise: how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in her Havana scenes. It's the bone structure! How i would've killed to have seen Miss Leigh in a role challenging Brando again.","The movie has been criticized for its slow pace, disjointed picture, and abrupt transitions into musical numbers. Some viewers found Sinatra's performance disappointing and his fiancé's accent intolerable. The only saving grace seemed to be Brando's understated singing."
Do you agree with the criticism of the film's authenticity and direction? Why or why not?,"Raising Victor Vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be: being real. Unfortunately, there is no reality to this film. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake.<br /><br />The reason? Bad directing. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems Mr. Sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel. Wrong! It just gives it a badly-made feel. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film, it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what's on screen instead of enhance it.<br /><br />Of course, what's on screen is so painfully fake, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look ""hip"" to his Sundance buddies and show how ""edgy"" a filmmaker he is.<br /><br />Overall, the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director Mr. Sollett is. Next time, how about taking a few writing and directing classes?","Despite the film's attempt to portray reality, Raising Victor Vargas falls short in delivering authentic characters and situations. The director's choice of not lighting the film and shaky camera work only adds to the artificiality of the movie, making it a struggle for viewers to connect with the story. The exaggerated script further highlights the filmmaker's misguided attempt to appear trendy and daring. In the end, the film leaves a lasting impression of poor directing choices and a lack of genuine storytelling."
Can you believe all the hype surrounding this film?,"What a bad, bad film!!! I can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious, amateurish excuse for a real movie!! I left the theater before the end, stunned by how bad the direction and camera-work of that movie were!! And to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry.<br /><br />At least this film showed me once and for all that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film-making than anything else.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs. You'll want your time back! I know I did.",The film is a bad excuse for a real movie with pretentious and amateurish direction and camera work. It fails to deliver on its promises and instead tries to deceive viewers with cheap and tawdry attempts at storytelling. The Sundance Festival has been called into question for showcasing such low-quality filmmaking. It is advised to avoid this film at all costs as it will only leave you wanting your time back.
How did the filmmakers create such an amateurish and unprofessional movie?,"First of all, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all we're not a Hollywood film.<br /><br />Then get amateur actors. It will be good for the festival hype. After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? Then, hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light. You see, if it's well-lit, it won't look ""real"" and the festival people won't like it. Who needs to have professional level photography anyway? Then hire a ten-year old who has never held a camera to be your operator. It will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for ""reality"" and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people, critics and a small sliver of the audience who over-intellectualize will scream ""genius"" because they won't believe this was just complete amateur-hour.<br /><br />Once you've done that, buy your ticket to the Festival of Bad Movies aka Sundance.<br /><br />What a sad waste.","The film's low budget approach with a script written on a napkin, amateur actors, poorly lit cinematography, and inexperienced camerawork led to a complete waste of time for viewers. Sundance or not, this movie was a sad display of mediocrity."
What makes Raising Victor Vargas a disappointing film?,"How many more of those fake ""slice of life"" movies need to be made? Hopefully not too many.<br /><br />Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood. Nothing wrong with that in general. What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly ""edgy"" Hollywood independent production.<br /><br />It's supposed to be ""real"" so left shake the camera ""documentary style"", except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose...<br /><br />It's ""edgy"" so let's not waste any time lighting the film.<br /><br />It's ""hip"", so let's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface...<br /><br />And so on, and so forth. All that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the ""rarefied"" indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film.","Raising Victor Vargas comes off as a contrived attempt to emulate a genuine ""slice of life"" movie, but falls short due to its reliance on Hollywood clichés and forced attempts at edginess. The shaky camera work, lack of proper lighting, and gratuitous use of profanity only serve to make it feel inauthentic and unimpressive to a wider audience beyond the indie film bubble."
"What makes this movie barely watchable and unbelievably boring according to the reviewer? 
Negative","I can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />In a no-budget way, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck.<br /><br />This film should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those ""festival films"" that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it ""different"", therefore good.<br /><br />Bad film-making is not ""different"", it's just bad film-making.","The movie managed to get a relatively high rating of 6, but it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring. It is considered one of the worst films in a long time, with aspects that remind the reviewer of a creative train wreck similar to Star Wars Episodes I and II. The film is advised to be avoided at all costs, as it seems to only please pseudo-intellectuals who appreciate its bad quality as something ""different."""
Can you elaborate on what made the film so awful and unenjoyable to watch?,"This ""film"" is one of the most dreadful things I have ever seen.<br /><br />Please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction.<br /><br />Shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as ""direction"", which this film needed in droves. Not that the writing was all the wonderful, rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary ""style"" prized by those who don't know how to direct).<br /><br />This film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film-making (which is most of them).<br /><br />Just terrible. It says a lot about Sundance and what it's become that Victor Vargas was showcased there.","The ""film"" is a terrible concoction, lacking proper direction, with artificial characters portrayed poorly in a pseudo-documentary style. It seems cynically made to appeal to those who don't understand filmmaking, making it one of the worst movies with no redeeming qualities."
"What are some flaws of the movie ""Raising Victor Vargas""?","Raising victor Vargas is just a bad film. No amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact.<br /><br />Maybe Peter Sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current ""edgy film-making"". Maybe he just doesn't know any better. It's hard to tell.<br /><br />What's not hard to tell is the result. Except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film-making into an attempt at pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it.<br /><br />I know I didn't.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and pass on this film.","Raising Victor Vargas is a disappointment, lacking in authenticity and failing to resonate with audiences. The director's apparent lack of resources or skill led to a film that appears to imitate modern edgy filmmaking without capturing its essence. Most viewers, like myself, were unable to find any enjoyment in this poorly executed attempt at pseudo-realism. It's best to avoid wasting your time on this film."
Was the movie able to effectively create suspense and tension throughout the storyline?,"Ho-hum. An inventor's(Horst Buchholz)deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly his son(Luke Perry)has been working on the antedote all along. Enter CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins. Also in the cast are:Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will be accepting. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at.","The plot of the movie felt cliche and uninspired, following predictable patterns of action sequences and character development. The performances from the cast, including Roger Moore, felt lackluster and unimpressive, failing to bring excitement to the screen. Additionally, Olivia d'Abo's portrayal as a CIA agent seemed miscast and did not add any depth to the character. Overall, the film lacked originality and failed to engage the audience in a meaningful way."
"What elements contributed to making the acting, cast, and props of the movie ""The Enemy"" horrible according to the review provided?","Horrible acting, horrible cast and cheap props. Would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie. What a waste. Starting from the name of the movie.<br /><br />""The Enemy"" Naming it ""Action Movie"" would've made it better. (contributing to the parody effect). The cop looking like a 60 Year old player, the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times. Towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie. Horrible. Don't waste your time.","The reviewer criticized the acting, cast, and props of the movie ""The Enemy,"" stating that they were all horrible and cheap. They believe that the movie would have been better as an action parody style film. The reviewer specifically mentioned that the name of the movie could have been improved by being called ""Action Movie"" to contribute to the parody effect. They also highlighted the poor casting choices, such as a 60-year-old actor playing a cop and a blond girl with a monotonous expression. The reviewer mentioned the lackluster chemistry between the two main characters during crucial scenes, comparing their dialogue to cheap lines before a sex scene in a pornographic movie. In conclusion, the reviewer advised against watching this movie, deeming it a waste of time."
"What character addition is criticized in the show ""Scooby and Scrappy-Doo""?","After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are You, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that spoilt Scooby-Doo success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo that made this show a complete failure, probably for both adults and kids together. Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up. Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should have either killed or never thought up Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids will prefer it!",Scrappy-Doo was described as a stupid and annoying character that ruined the success of the show. The addition of Scrappy was seen as a poor decision that made the show a complete failure for both adults and kids.
"What are some aspects of the show ""Scooby Doo Where Are You"" that disappointed you?","I grew up on Scooby Doo Where Are You, and I still love it. It is one of my favourite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show though is good for kids, the voices are good(Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation. However it is rather disappointing. I normally don't mind Scrappy, but when he appears to be like the main character, it gets annoying fast. Complete with the catchphrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual. Also half the gang are missing after the first year, somehow it didn't feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal, very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo:Get a Clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voices, theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids. Bethany Cox","While the animation, voices, and theme tune are decent and suitable for kids, the presence of Scrappy as a main character quickly becomes annoying with his repetitive catchphrase. Additionally, the absence of half the gang after the first year makes it feel less like a true Scooby Doo show. The jokes and storylines are often unoriginal and lack excitement, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience overall."
What are some major drawbacks of the movie in terms of characters and overall enjoyment?,"While I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its horrid production values), it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it?! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the BETTER episodes!! After many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the live-action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy-Doo--since practically everyone hates him!","The addition of Scrappy-Doo as a character in this film has been widely criticized as annoying, unfunny, and nerve-grating, with many viewers finding the character to be one of the worst creations for children. The decision to include Scrappy-Doo in the story has been heavily condemned, leading to a significant decline in enjoyment for audiences."
"Why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast, and why was the writing so bad that it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters?","That is the only question I am left with. Why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast? Why was the writing so bad, it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters? Why did it not make any sense at all? Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and ""Hollywood"" the hell out of it when all it needed was good, smart story telling? Why? I never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released. I hope for the sake of Freeman an Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, that this never is released to the big screens in America.<br /><br />As someone that holds a Bachelors Degree in Journalism, the whole story is just utterly laughable. I just...think the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a cliché, and an awful one at that. Just. No.","Question: Why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast, and why was the writing so bad that it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters?"
What were some disappointing aspects of the film according to a review?,"I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). However, that said, I found this film extremely tiresome. Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clichés and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but they're all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and ""cute"" appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance, see a different movie.","Despite enjoying the beautiful scenery and Peter Falk's performance, this film was described as extremely tiresome, with annoying sequences filled with clichés and shtick. The humor felt forced, and the director's indecisiveness between aiming for laughs or tears was evident. The film was criticized for lacking substance and relying too heavily on sentimentality and cheap laughs."
Did you notice the inconsistency in the roads and setting throughout the movie?,"Did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads. Like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks, next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider, next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work.<br /><br />I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie. If, however, you find his work/not funny then I would recommend staying away from this one.","The changes in the road settings during car scenes were really distracting and took away from the overall quality of the film. It felt like a careless mistake that could have easily been avoided, making the movie seem sloppy. Additionally, if you are not a fan of Paul Reiser's comedy style, you might find this movie uninteresting and lacking in humor."
What made this movie frustrating to watch?,"This movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father. Very predictable. Both Male ""stars"" need a good slap in the face! Would you like some cheese with that ""whine?"" Two chuckles...and a headache. I can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years...I don't know how she lasted that long! The first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing I had never paid the $3.99 to watch it! The movie didn't flow well and was painfully long. I kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster...It didn't. The script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space. On a positive note...the scenery was pretty, fall being my favorite season. The car, the 40 Ford was also quite nice. This movie gets an D- rating approaching an F","The movie dragged on with constant arguing between the son and father, making it predictable and tedious. The characters were unlikable and the storyline lacked originality, leaving little enjoyment for the audience. Overall, the film failed to engage viewers and felt like a waste of time and money."
Can you share your thoughts on the movie Herculis Puaro?,"Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story don't work and i felt its not Agatha's mistake. The cast isn't good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. The story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! The 'victim' is not likable.","The movie Herculis Puaro fails to capture the essence of the beloved character from the books and movies. The cast's performances are lackluster, with over-exaggerated acting and unrealistic costumes. Instead of a gripping mystery drama, the film comes off as a comedy to more serious viewers. The plot lacks enchantment, centered around the murder of an unlikable character in an Iraqi desert. Overall, the movie falls short in delivering a compelling and engaging story."
Why should I be subjected to such a slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot? Why does this movie lack character development and rely on stereotypes?,"Why me? Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot?! At least if I can warn other people off, it will have been worthwhile.<br /><br />I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear. The movie was slow, had PAINFULLY little character development, and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an LA-style token black man.<br /><br />If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note, though, that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an ""LA lifestyle"", it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from it.","The movie was slow, had painfully little character development, and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an LA-style token black man.

"What were your overall thoughts on the movie ""Prête-moi ta main""?","I first didn't want to watch this film, for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film...but as I recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising ""Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité"""" which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (screenwriter of ""prête-moi ta main""), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that ""Prête-moi ta main"", would be as good as ""mensonges..."". And it is absolutely not. The script is not bad, but it is not as well directed as ""Mensonges..."", the actors not as generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as she usually is) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and too be honest, I still don't understand how such crap can have such a success, even with such a casting... Anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it is not as good as Tirard's ""Mensonges..."" though it's also written by him. Easy, unsurprising, and lazy work. Totally overestimated!","The movie was a huge disappointment compared to the director's previous work. The script was mediocre, the direction lacked depth, and the actors failed to bring life to their characters, especially Charlotte. The story had potential for interesting plots but fell short, resulting in a lazy and unimpressive film."
Have you ever wanted to see a group of giant robots battling it out in a desert wasteland?,"There's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland, and Robot Wars does deliver. Sure, the acting is lousy, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged fairly well. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime, and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction.","While Robot Wars may offer the spectacle of giant robots duking it out, the overall quality of the film leaves much to be desired. The acting is weak, the dialogue lacks depth, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The special effects, while decent for its time, are far from the polished CGI we are used to today. Despite its short runtime, the film's flaws are hard to overlook, making it a struggle to sit through unless you are solely interested in seeing giant robots smashing each other."
What could have been done to improve the movie and make it more enjoyable for the audience?,"This film has a weak plot, weak characterization, and really weak special effects that I question why I lost valuable life by watching it. It has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. The robots are sad and the main ""hero"" 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. If this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable, but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. It's sad when you root for the bad guy, because he's the best one to cheer for. When all is said and done, this movie was better left on the cutting room floor, or never funded at all.","This movie was a complete disaster with a weak plot, poor character development, and subpar special effects. The random characters felt like fillers, and the robots were unimpressive. It's evident that the director's choices seemed more about personal agendas than enhancing the story. The supposed hero-bot's activation with a knife switch was just plain ridiculous and took away any seriousness from the film. The fact that the main villain was the most interesting character speaks volumes about the lack of depth in the protagonist. Overall, this movie was a waste of time and should have never seen the light of day."
What makes Jean Harlow stand out in The Girl from Missouri?,"I'm a Jean Harlow fan, because she had star quality. I don't think her movies are good and I don't even think that she was a good actress, but she certainly was Great in comedies. Every bit of comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this movie is perhaps more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. It always impresses me much to think that Harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman. Well, in this movie she does look beautiful.","Despite Jean Harlow's performance shining in the comedy aspects of the movie, the rest of the cast falls flat, and the overall plot leans more towards a generic love story. The lackluster performances from the supporting cast fail to bring anything original to the film. While Harlow's physical beauty is undeniable, the movie itself fails to leave a lasting impression beyond her presence."
What were some disappointing aspects of the movie remake?,"I have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this.<br /><br />GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the ""supporting supporting actors"" did very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun.<br /><br />BAD: The escape from the ape city was terrible. The characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape. Plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom?<br /><br />The story was pared down to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.<br /><br />Finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented. Without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it.<br /><br />","The escape from the ape city was poorly executed, with illogical escape routes that led through bedrooms, and the story lacked depth compared to the original film, focusing more on action rather than substance. The ending was nonsensical and left viewers feeling unsatisfied without the promise of a sequel."
What is wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character in the movie?,"Spoilers I guess.<br /><br /> The absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie. I just couldn't get over it. And what is wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes, I'd be all like, "" AAAAhhhhHHH!!! Run for your lives! The monkeys have inherited the Earth!"" But he's all like, ""talking apes, okay. Next?"" That's pretty jaded I'd say. He must run into even stranger things on a regular basis. Besides that, this is Rick Baker's best work yet. This film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field. 3/10.",The ending of the movie is so illogical that it ruins the entire film. Mark Wahlberg's character's reaction to encountering talking apes is unrealistic and off-putting. The movie only deserves a 3 out of 10 rating because of these flaws.
What were some major disappointments in the movie?,"Being a big fan of the ""other"" PLANET OF THE APES films, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton. Once again, he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even the ape makeup looks second rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS wasn't proof enough). I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche-ridden screenplay. I rented this DVD on a special $1 night and I still feel ripped off.","The ape makeup looked second rate and the direction was uninspired. Mark Wahlberg's performance was lackluster, and the screenplay was filled with cliches. The talented actors in the movie seemed to be motivated by their paychecks rather than the quality of the film. Overall, the movie felt like a rip-off even with a discounted rental price."
"Why did the reviewer feel disappointed with the Tim Burton remake of ""Planet of the Apes""?","This Tim Burton remake of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" from 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is a far, far cry from the quality and plot of the original.<br /><br />Certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialog was awful. I sat through the entire film with a friend (who thankfully only rented it) and completely understood why, before Christmas, all of the ""Planet of the Apes"" toys at Target were in the clearance bin.<br /><br />My advice to Tim Burton: don't put this on your resume.<br /><br />My advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" movie.","The Tim Burton remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" was heavily criticized for its uninteresting characters, poor dialogue, and overall lackluster writing. The reviewer found the film to be a far cry from the original 1968 classic, advising both Tim Burton to skip adding this to his resume and audiences to stick with the superior original version."
What did you find disappointing about the movie Planet of the Apes?,"I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge dissapointment.<br /><br />The settings and masks are great, but that is the only good aspect of the film. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. The other actors are also not very good.<br /><br />But the worst point of all, is the story. It is absolutely ridiculous! For example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! This is just one example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.","I really looked forward to seeing Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge disappointment.

Was this movie able to deliver as a thriller film?<br />,"Oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace.<br /><br />I am not usually this critical about any movie, cause every person has his/her style. But this movie, however, was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and i think it should stay like this, for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke.<br /><br />I advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies, or even simply movies to stay far away from this one.","This movie was a complete disaster in terms of its plot, acting, and overall execution. It felt like it was written by a child, and the quality of the props and filming was subpar. It's hard to believe that a movie like this even exists in 2008.

What were some major flaws in the movie?,"Words can't describe how utterly stupid this story (and therefore bad this movie) is! Basinger, Del Toro ... what were you thinking ??

COME ON !!! I won't even go into the infamous red toolbox, since other people have done that before. Let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one.<br /><br />This is so stupid, without the least bit of logic, I can only warn you watching it, it's a TOTAL waste of time, honestly !!","The storyline of the movie was incredibly nonsensical, lacking any sense of logic. The actions of the characters were unrealistic and the plot progression left much to be desired. Overall, it was a total waste of time and not worth watching."
What aspects of the film failed to create a believable and engaging storyline?,"Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting scared, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall, she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. I can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, screaming for God to come help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others. Please trust me, this is bad and a bit tasteless as well.","The plot in this thriller was incredibly lacking in logic and credibility, with scenes that made it hard to take the story seriously. The actions of the characters, especially the protagonist, seemed irrational and unbelievable, leading to a tasteless and ridiculous portrayal that ultimately detracted from the film's quality."
What are the major criticisms of this movie according to the review provided?<br>,"Who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie?<br /><br />Accidental killing of a security guard... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them... and better...<br /><br />A red toolbox of death? Please....<br /><br />Hypothermic weak thugs...<br /><br />Acting from hell...<br /><br />Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female ... (uhm) Rambo?<br /><br />Unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person. Do not watch, walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine...<br /><br />And on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...<br /><br />Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(","The reviewer clearly dislikes the movie, finding fault with the ridiculous accidental killing, poorly developed characters, the unrealistic concept of a ""red toolbox of death,"" weak performances, and a confusing mix of genres. The reviewer feels the movie is insulting to viewers and overly graphic in its violence, ultimately branding it as pathetic and terrible."
What made this movie disturbing and over the top?,"This is one seriously disturbed movie. Even Though the boys deserved some of what they got.....the sadistic gruesome executions were ""slightly"" over the top. The only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair, but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security, before the joy of what was to come. <br /><br />The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled, ""and, where is the batman?"". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /><br />Now that would have been cool!","The sadistic gruesome executions in the movie were excessive and unnecessary, making it seriously disturbing. The character who showed conscience was killed off too early, leaving the plot void of any potential help. The initial promise of a mediocre storyline was just a trick to lure viewers before subjecting them to the extreme violence depicted. If only Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger had made surprising appearances to save the day, the movie could have been more enjoyable."
What are some elements of the film that make it difficult to take seriously?,"She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she also is a perennial Razzie nominee. To do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money. She could do ads on why you shouldn't talk on a cell phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded mall.<br /><br />Susan Montford should stick to producing (Shoot 'Em Up ) as she is not very good as a writer/director.<br /><br />She is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot, and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun. What does she do? She starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something. She manages to get away, but gets lost in the forest after crashing. Why didn't she run to someones house? We get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox. Of course, their guns are no match for her wrench. Ha! Of course, she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver. Those poor thugs.<br /><br />Now, she's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!","The film's storyline seems implausible and lacks depth, with the protagonist's actions appearing unrealistic and exaggerated. The character development is weak, making it hard to connect with the main character or care about her journey. The film's direction and writing leave much to be desired, with the plot relying too heavily on clichés and predictable outcomes. Additionally, the film's action sequences come across as laughable rather than thrilling, further undermining any attempt at creating suspense or tension."
What makes this suspense film fall flat for viewers?,"The genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and is just not believable. I find that the more I watch this kind of movie, the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger. Continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I might have enjoyed it a little. Having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one.","The movie lacks plausibility, making it predictable and unbelievable. The characters' constant bad decisions border on stupidity, hindering the overall viewing experience."
Why did the critics find this film so disappointing despite the involvement of notable names like Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger?,"I can't believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage! The script is so poorly written and the directing so weak (both by the same person) that its hard to find more one-dimension characters in a film. The dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre. The setup it's tricky, inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film. Bassinger's character is so dumb, that she actually stops to scream to God ""Where are you!"" so the people after her can follow, and then takes a leak!!!! And then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her, and this happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder, is that really the best writing people in Hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it.","The script is poorly written, the directing is weak with one-dimensional characters, and the plot transitions from promising to ridiculous. The dialogue is laughable, the protagonist's actions are nonsensical, and the overall quality of the film leaves much to be desired. The film fails to deliver on its potential, leaving both critics and viewers questioning the credibility of those involved in its production."
What are some examples of unrealistic scenarios that impact the realism of the movie?,"Where to start...Oh yea, Message to the bad guys: When you first find the person you have been tracking (in order to kill) that witnessed a crime you committed, don't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away. Message to the victim: When the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing, take that opportunity to ""RUN AWAY"", don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear. Message to the Director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot, you can't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away! time and motion doesn't work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman doesn't have to brutally kill( 4) men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home.","The movie features unrealistic scenarios such as bad guys giving victims unnecessary opportunities to escape, victims failing to take advantage of opportunities to flee, and unrealistic speed of bad guys catching up to their targets despite a significant head start. Additionally, the constant portrayal of women resolving conflicts through brutal killings to gain empowerment may be viewed as overly exaggerated and lacking depth."

"Who might find this movie enjoyable, and who may not?","OK, if you're a woman who's got aggression issues, you might like this movie. Hate your significant other? This movie is for you. For the guys, it will be a bag of laughs.<br /><br />It's sad when former award winning actresses have to do cut rate movies.<br /><br />The only really good part is the last 10 seconds. Even that was a load of cheese.<br /><br />My wife is picking the worst movies lately. This is what you get (I) for letting my wife pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites.","The film seems to cater more towards women with aggression issues or those looking for a good laugh at the expense of their significant other. However, viewers were disappointed with the overall quality of the movie, with one mentioning their regret at letting their wife select movies based on online reviews. The only redeeming factor was deemed to be the final 10 seconds, but even that was criticized for being overly cheesy."
"What is the general plot of the movie ""Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell""?","A dog found in a local kennel is mated with Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit & run. The puppy wants no time in making like Donald Trump and firing the Mexican housekeeper, how festive. Only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch. So it's up to dad to say the day.<br /><br />This late 70's made for TV horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia. When I saw this as a kid I found it to be a tense nail-biter, but revisiting it as an adult I now realize that it's merely lame,boring, and not really well-acted in the least bit.<br /><br />My Grade: D","The movie ""Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell"" fails to live up to its potential with a weak plot and lackluster acting. The storyline of a demonic puppy causing chaos within a family is not engaging, and the nostalgia factor does not make up for the overall boredom and unconvincing performances. Overall, the film ends up being a disappointing watch, earning a low grade of D."
What are some of the major flaws in the film?,"They really can't get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.<br /><br />Trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she comes out of all that. The girls go through drunken rages, exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense.<br /><br />It really can't get much worse than this awful film.","This movie is a complete disaster with a plot that is beyond ridiculous. The attempt to capture the college spirit is utterly cringeworthy and the characters are extremely unlikeable. The humor falls flat, the dialogue is uninspired, and overall the film is just a cringe-inducing mess. The portrayal of the female characters is shallow and outdated, relying on tired stereotypes. Save yourself the time and avoid this trainwreck of a movie at all costs."
"How can a movie with Amy, Posey, and Raechel have NOTHING funny in it? Believe it or not 'House Bunny' did this better and funnier. Hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is an embarrassment to all of them. It is a cliché from beginning to end. Clichés can work well with a script, or at least an idea. This movie does nothing but use cliché after cliché rather than ideas or script. It uses the preexisting persona's of the actresses rather than develop characters. Bad, sad, and rubbish. Now I apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why?

It relies on tired clichés throughout, lacking any original ideas or character development. The actresses' existing personas are simply recycled instead of creating engaging characters. Overall, a disappointing and cringeworthy film that misses the mark completely."
What are some common criticisms of this movie?,"I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but not many as bad as this. It is a movie that makes fun of fat people, has no real story, has bad actors, is not funny and much more. Is this a movie that you would like to see? I guess not!<br /><br />I guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was made by a 12 year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all. The so called funny parts is as funny as throughing pies in the faces of people, or breaking wind. Of cource if this is the kind of humour that you like, then this is the movie for you!!<br /><br />Dont waste your money on this movie!","This movie has been widely criticized for making fun of overweight individuals, lacking a coherent storyline, featuring subpar acting, and failing to deliver any genuine humor. The attempt at originality and creativity comes off as amateurish and juvenile, with humor that relies on cheap and tasteless gags. It's best to avoid wasting your money on this film."
Did the movie effectively engage the audience and maintain their interest throughout?,"You know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well this was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $3.00 and I'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of pathetic. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. Around 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour, we compromised to fast forward to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, don't watch this movie. It is beyond painful.","This movie was a complete disaster, an absolute waste of time and money. The storyline was confusing, the characters were poorly developed, and the acting was subpar at best. I found myself checking my watch constantly, eagerly waiting for it to be over. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the overall production quality was lacking. Save yourself the agony and avoid watching this film at all costs."
"What makes ""Fatty Drives the Bus"" such a disappointing and unbearable movie-watching experience?",i completely agree with jamrom4.. this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen.. holy crap it was terrible.. i was warned not to see it..and foolishly i watched it anyway.. about 10 minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity..but sat through until the end..just to see if i could.. well i did and now i wish i had not..it was disgusting..nothing happened and the ending was all preachy..no movie that bad has the right to survive..i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus..if only i had heeded the same warning..please save yourself from this movie..i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie..and should all be wiped off the face of the planet..,"This movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish. Everything about it was just terrible. The storyline was nonexistent, the characters were unlikable, and the whole thing was just a preachy mess. It's shocking that movies this bad are even allowed to exist. I genuinely regret wasting my time watching this atrocious film. Avoid it at all costs."
"What do you think about the casting of Bobby Flay and Mario Batali in the movie ""Pineapple Salsa""? Have you noticed any issues with their performance and involvement in the movie?","Weak Bobby ""Pineapple Salsa"" Flay and Mario Batali bring this down.<br /><br />Flay being the worst. Definitely a one trick pony, I think they could have gotten other American chefs to come to the table on this one as the Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes this duo come up with really...don't reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I don't think Batali even went to chef school, actually. There are a lot of great chefs in America, I just wonder why they don't appear on the Food Network.<br /><br />It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he is a bit too flippant/funny for this role.","The casting of Bobby Flay and Mario Batali in ""Pineapple Salsa"" may have brought down the movie, with Flay being criticized as a one-trick pony and Batali's lack of formal culinary training being questioned. The duo's dishes were not seen as reflective of the creativity of the original Iron Chef series, and it was suggested that other American chefs could have brought more to the table. Additionally, there were concerns raised about the need for more regional ingredients and co-hosts who could better handle the pressure, with Alton Brown being seen as somewhat mismatched for his role."
Did the show manage to keep viewers engaged with its underwater adventures and storyline?,"The show's echoed 'bubbling' sound effect used to put me to sleep. A very soothing show. I think I might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril. I had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would assume Lloyd Bridges never dove there. I only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge-of-the-seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house... imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads. I thought 'Flipper' had better undersea action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.","The show's slow pace and lack of excitement made it easy for viewers to doze off during the less intense parts. The constant echoed 'bubbling' sound effect, though soothing, didn't add much excitement to the show. The underwater action was underwhelming compared to other shows like 'Flipper', leaving viewers wishing for more engaging scenes."
What aspects of the movie failed to impress you?,"this movie had a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow... very slow indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.<br /><br />the cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either. the sounds are OK. lighting OK.<br /><br />i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student.<br /><br />the movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid.<br /><br />no winnings here, skip this utter boredom. i've seen worse believe me, but this is just waste of time, and i don't get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings...","The pacing of the movie was extremely slow, making it hard to stay engaged. While the cinematography and sounds were passable, they were nothing remarkable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other than maybe a film student. The lack of music, along with unnecessary scenes like horses having sex and a woman masturbating, added nothing to the film and came across as pointless. Overall, I found this movie to be utterly boring and a waste of time."
What are some major flaws in the film that made it unenjoyable for some viewers?,"This, and Immoral Tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film, it's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense -- they're not explained at all. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story, but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty, sex-negative, morality play.","The film was critiqued for its poor execution, with instances of bad acting and inconsistencies in character development. The abrupt shifts in characters' behaviors and the problematic portrayal of interracial relationships were particularly off-putting for some viewers. The central concept of a mysterious ""sexy beast"" in the woods had potential but was ultimately wasted on a moralistic and anti-sex message."
"Was this movie able to deliver on the unique film experience that was promised by a friend?

### Negative","This movie is little more than poorly-made, fetish porn, and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era. This was recommended to me by friend as a ""unique film experience."" He was right. I suppose he meant that as a joke. Not disgusting, not even that shocking. Just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art. A little bit of camp value, though I don't believe the makers of this film intended this. And yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit. Don't spend a lot of money on this. Try to borrow it, if you must see it. Or contact me, I'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price.<br /><br />I may have to see another of this particular director's films, as he seems to have a certain following. But if it's anything like this, I will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever.","This movie fails to live up to any expectations of being a unique film experience. Instead, it comes across as poorly-made fetish porn with mediocre acting and failed attempts at shock art. The central concept of sex with a guy in a bear suit adds nothing of value, and the overall result is not only unimpressive but also a waste of time. The director's attempt at creating a following with this film falls flat, leaving viewers regretting the time spent watching it."
What were the expectations surrounding this film and how did it fail to deliver?,"this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after item...the outrage, the mystery, etc. it had everything to be a great piece of film-making, but ultimately fails in every extent. it's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror movie, a lame erotic film.<br /><br />the 2 disc DVD includes a gorgeous booklet with stills, interviews, essays on bestiality, etc. as well as an extensive interview with the more-than-pretentious director. for those who have heard about it but never seen it, the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film. disc 1 contains the edited film, badly translated to English but with good visual quality. disc 2 contains the director's cut, in an awful transfer, in french.<br /><br />what can I say about the actual beast? a hand puppet of Kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking.","The film was hyped up due to its scandalous nature, but despite the anticipation, it fell short in every aspect. It tried to be a comedy, horror, and erotic film but failed miserably in all genres. The DVD extras were impressive, but the film itself was a disappointment. The director's cut was particularly poorly executed. The use of a hand puppet would have been more effective than the actual beast in the movie."
Can you elaborate on what makes the film's portrayal of the beast so ridiculous and unconvincing?,"Completely ridiculous ""period"" film is only a thin excuse for its extensive, graphic depiction of the heroine's affair with ""the beast"", a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women. That's pretty much what he does, and the film's depiction of the beast is really really awful; it's basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard-on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I guess maybe this is a real turn-on. I was amused, however, by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square.","The film's attempt to create a menacing and mysterious beast falls completely flat as it simply portrays a tall man in a cheap fur suit with a questionable PVC tube prop. The special effects are poorly executed, leaving the audience more incredulous than terrified. The graphic scenes involving the beast also come off as distasteful and amateurish, failing to evoke any genuine sense of fear or suspense. Overall, the beast's portrayal is a major disappointment and undermines the supposed central conflict of the film."
What makes this movie a complete waste of time and money according to the reviewer?,"This Movie is complete crap! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it is rambling and incoherent. I pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70's sleaze cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you. The saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang. I mean its just plain hard to sit through, not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly. Please, I know the cover is interesting (what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman's bare ass)but don't waste your time or money as you won't get either back.","The movie is criticized for being rambling, incoherent, and lacking a coherent story. The reviewer found the acting terrible, the soundtrack poorly dubbed, and even the notable werewolf suit with a functional 'wang' failed to save it. The overall viewing experience was described as hard to sit through, and the recommendation given was to avoid this film entirely."
Does the film lack drama and fail to engage the audience?,"Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom. One cares not who wins, loses, dies or lives--just end it as soon as possible. This is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them. They might better be done on a bare stage and left that way. One cannot expect the amazing effects of ""The House of the Flying Daggers"" or ""The Golden Compass,"" but , after all, this is a 2002 digitally mastered production. Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene, so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms. In my view, this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the ""papier-mache"" revolution of a ""papier colle"" world.","This film suffers from a lack of excitement and fails to evoke any emotional investment from the audience. The scenes feel artificial and the characters seem to lack depth, making it difficult to care about their fates. The setting, which should have been captivating, comes across as dull and uninspiring. Overall, the film fails to bring the French Revolution to life in a compelling way."
"What are the shortcomings of the film ""The Lady and the Duke""?","Eric Rohmer's 'The Lady and the Duke' is based on the journals of an English aristocrat who lived through the French revolution. But it's a stilted affair, with its strange, painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone. Most notably, this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie, and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted, but spoilt, aristocratic classes. The result is frequently dull, and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director.","The film fails to fully capture the tumultuous setting of the French revolution, as it remains detached from the real action and lacks insight into the broader societal impacts. The use of painted backdrops and mannered conversations add to its stilted nature, resulting in a dull and ultimately unenlightening viewing experience."
Was the film engaging and entertaining overall?,"I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works I've quite enjoyed. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word but ""enduring"" will do), left me in a vile mood, a condition relieved only by reading the IMDb user comment by ali-112. For not only has Rohmer attempted (with success) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France but, as ali has pointed out, has shown (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times. The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult, but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor.","The film failed to captivate the audience with its dull and boring storyline. The slow pace and uninteresting characters left viewers feeling disconnected and uninterested in the events unfolding on screen. Overall, THE LADY AND THE DUKE lacked the entertainment factor needed to keep viewers engaged throughout."
"What were the expectations for ""Alive"" based on a previous movie experience?","Having seen Versus previously I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Alive did not deliver. VERY slow development. Loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals. The premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up. Could have done so much more at the end. Most of the movie is just "" sitting around "". To put it plainly, three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end. It really needed more shock elements. If you are looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment.","The movie ""Alive"" was a disappointment, as it had a very slow development and lacked the anticipated shock elements. Despite the promising premise and cool visuals, the film failed to deliver and left the viewers struggling to make it through to the end. It missed the mark in terms of building up the action and excitement, resulting in a less gripping and engaging experience."
Did this movie leave a lasting impression on the audience?,"I went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it is still the dullest movie I've ever seen. It just went on and on with no discernible point and then - it just ended. The lights came up and I watched everyone looking around in confusion. Had the projectionist missed a reel? I've never had the urge to find out. All I remember about the movie is that it was a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords. Fortunately, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce, and Karen Black.","The movie was a complete bore, lacking any clear purpose or entertainment value. The storyline dragged on endlessly, leaving viewers confused and unsatisfied. It failed to engage the audience, resulting in a dull and forgettable experience."
"What impact did the controversy surrounding the University of Oregon have on the production of the movie? 
Negative","As a member of the cast, I was a member of the band at all the basketball games, I would like to let the world know after being in the movie, that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. Seems that the U of O sign was shown. While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met. Quite a time for a young 20 year old. BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60's and early 70's despite what Hollywood may think. Trombone player from Oregon","This movie faced a major setback when it was banned in Oregon due to contract violations with the university where it was filmed. Additionally, reports of ill-mannered behavior by actor Jack Nicholson on set have emerged, tarnishing the overall experience of the cast and crew. The portrayal of campus life in the late 60's and early 70's was deemed far from realistic, casting doubts on the authenticity of the film's narrative."
What makes you dislike the movie so much?,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is (I think) a story of a rebellious college basketball player, his tough-but-fair coach, his girlfriend, and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who has continual nervous breakdowns. The story goes nowhere, there is zero character development, there is nobody to care about, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as the coach, are terrible. It is hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such an awful movie. Make sure to avoid this turkey.","This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is confusing and lacks depth, the characters are poorly developed, and most of the performances are cringeworthy. It's a huge disappointment that such a talented actor like Jack Nicholson directed this mess. Avoid wasting your time on this one."
What elements of the film failed to impress the reviewer?,"never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire.i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice.maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film.i found it unbelievable,lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilted.a musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop ain't.the acting by Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue. perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didn't fit into any genre,it didn't elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense,in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters!","The movie was described as dire, with an unrealistic storyline that lacked atmosphere. The performances by the actors were deemed passable but not strong enough to save the weak plot and feeble dialogue. The reviewer found it hard to connect with the characters or feel any suspense, ultimately leading to a desire for the movie to end and a wish to physically reprimand the main characters."
What aspects of the movie failed to impress the reviewer?,"Disappointing and irritating. The screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion. Character is not explored in depth. These are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element, the mother's affair with her daughter's lover. <br /><br />Anne Reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines, such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye. The script portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde without any hints about why, except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene. <br /><br />A mature writer could have done so much more with this topic.","The screenwriter demonstrated a lack of understanding of human nature and relied on clichés in a disjointed manner. Characters were poorly developed and felt like puppets in a poorly constructed plot. The portrayal of Darren as a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde lacked depth and reasoning beyond using cocaine. Overall, the movie seemed like a missed opportunity for a more mature writer to explore its potential fully."
"What are some of the aspects that led to disappointment in the movie Zavet, compared to the director's earlier works?","After Life is a Miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for instance. Zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. It appears that Kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, beginning with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his early films so much, and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. Let's hope his next one will be great.","Zavet was a letdown compared to the director's previous films, lacking a cohesive storyline and relying on silly antics that felt more like pathetic buffoonery. It seems Kusturica's filmmaking has been declining since shifting towards life-affirming comedies, with this movie lacking the charm and humor of his earlier works."
What makes this movie a complete disaster according to critics?,"An absolutely wretched waste of film!! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, hardly any train, no mystery, no interest. The constant and BRUTAL attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place, because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad leaves them no place to stay, in a heavy storm? I think not. Oh, they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields. umm, yeah. Sure. Or, they can force themselves on the railroad's hospitality, and stay at the 'haunted' train station. A station which proved to be nothing but DEADLY BORING, utterly without ghosts, interest, or plot.<br /><br />So very terribly dull that this seems impossible.<br /><br />This ought to be added to the LOST FILMS list !! aargh !!","This movie is an absolute disaster! It is a wretched waste of time with no ghosts, no mystery, and no intrigue. The attempts at comedy are forced and painful to watch. The premise of the story is utterly idiotic, leaving the audience frustrated and incredulous. The setting and lack of plot make the entire film extremely dull and boring. This movie deserves a spot on the list of lost films!"
"What are some common criticisms of the movie ""Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii""?","Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii... Full of clichés, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. If you have nothing better to do however, it does provide 40 minutes of simple, unpretensive entertainment, endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. On the other hand, If you are looking for anything more than that, stay away...<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, if you have ever worked in a Hotel or know anything about running one, you have two options: 1. You will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents Hotel Business or, 2. Look at it as science fiction comedy as I did, lie back, relax, and laugh about it!","The movie has been criticized for being full of clichés, highly predictable, and unrealistic. It has also been described as sometimes stupid and lacking depth. Additionally, the portrayal of the hotel business is seen as inaccurate and silly, which may bother viewers with knowledge or experience in that industry."
What crucial elements are missing in the movie that make the plot confusing and the characters unrelatable?,"Someone mentioned editing. This is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. For starters, let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in? And, what exactly are they testing? Apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit. The acting is pretty bad. Everyone is emoting. Everyone is keeping secrets. They frequently mention that if it weren't for the money, they'd hang it up. There's a deranged minister who spouts scripture. On and on. But, again, the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors. There are some really cheesy elements. Those little rooms and those chaise lounges. The awful wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). It was interesting, but didn't seem to go anywhere.","The movie suffers from poor editing, bad acting, and a lack of clear direction in terms of the experiments being conducted and the motivations of the characters. The storyline becomes messy and incomprehensible, leaving viewers baffled about the purpose of the experiments and the agency behind them. The characters fail to engage the audience due to their unrealistic behavior and shallow development. Additionally, the cheesy elements like the deranged minister and the tacky set design further detract from the overall viewing experience. Ultimately, the film fails to deliver a coherent narrative and fails to provide a compelling story that would keep the audience invested."
"What makes this movie so awful, and why should viewers avoid it?","Oh, my gosh...I thought CBS primetime television shows were the<br /><br />worst things Gerald McRaney appeared in...<br /><br />Four people are experimented on by a crazed mind control<br /><br />computer. That's it, don't rent it.<br /><br />I saw this under one of its many titles- ""Grey Matter,"" and it is<br /><br />perhaps one of the worst films of recent memory. The other<br /><br />reviews are right, it is awful. Never have so many establishing<br /><br />shots appeared onscreen, NEVER. The cast is awful, the direction<br /><br />is awful, and the script is awful. I cannot stress how awful this is. <br /><br />Avoid it like you would smallpox.<br /><br />This is rated (PG) for physical violence, some gun violence, mild<br /><br />gore, some profanity, and some adult situations","The movie ""Grey Matter"" has been described as one of the worst films of recent memory. The cast, direction, and script are all dreadful, with an excessive number of establishing shots that add nothing to the story. The film includes physical violence, gun violence, mild gore, profanity, and adult situations. Viewers are advised to steer clear of this movie due to its poor quality and lackluster execution."
Do you think The Brain Machine lived up to its potential with its release date discrepancy?,"Let's see, here are the ""highlights"" of The Brain Machine: 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a bland technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment.<br /><br />Various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the DVD box of 1977. That's an easy one to explain. This dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years, until someone dusted it off, thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-Watergate mood of distrust in government. After seeing The Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it ever got released at all!",The Brain Machine is a tedious mess filled with repetitive shots and uninspired characters. Its delayed release only highlights the fact that it should have stayed shelved.
What are some common signs that a movie might not be worth watching?,"You know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles. Generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets. Such a turkey is The Brain Machine which has seven different titles.<br /><br />Its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves, or something like that. Its filled with B level TV actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense.<br /><br />Its a turkey of the untastey kind. Avoid it.","You can tell a movie might not be worth the watch if it has multiple alternate titles, like The Brain Machine, a confusing film with B-level TV actors attempting to make sense of a nonsensical script. Avoid this turkey of a movie."
"What were some of the weaknesses in the movie ""River of Souls"" according to the reviewer?","I was very disappointed in this movie. Plotwise it was weak bordering on silly: Souls who can affect reality in the way they do? A mission apparently critical to the Soul Hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole B-story with the ""holobrothel"" and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point I blurted out to the television, ""Why are you wasting my time with this?""<br /><br />Thematically, ""River of Souls"" didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode ""Soul Hunter"" did. We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still don't get a feeling for their culture. (Are there any female Soul Hunters?)<br /><br />The acting was okay, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planetscapes in the first act - were very impressive. But overall, I'd say give this one a miss.","The reviewer found the plot weak and bordering on silly, with a mission entrusted to a younger member of the Soul Hunters that was deemed critical. The B-story featuring a ""holobrothel"" and a lawsuit against the station was considered awful, leaving the reviewer feeling like their time was being wasted. Thematically, the movie failed to delve deeper into the question of the soul compared to the original episode, lacking depth in exploring Soul Hunter culture. The acting was seen as okay considering the weak material, and while the special effects were impressive, it was not enough to salvage the movie, ultimately recommending to skip it."
"Can you elaborate on why the movie ""Kiss of the Dragon"" failed to impress you?","It's hard to believe an ""action"" packed Jet Li movie could be so boring, but this was transcendant trash. The plot is an amalgam of other Hong Kong chopsocky flicks. The martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent. <br /><br />It's a comic book story about a group of super-human soldiers who are to be killed because they're mentally unstable, one of their number (Li) who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian. The saved killers resurface with an Austin Powers quality plot to take over the world, and Li sheds his new life to save the world.<br /><br />The version I saw was dubbed, and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer-thin plot and comic-book 25 cent special effects. But I suspect even Ninja-Turtle-watching 8-year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow.","The movie ""Kiss of the Dragon"" was a disaster in terms of keeping the audience engaged. With a recycled plot from other Hong Kong action films, subpar martial arts action relying heavily on special effects, and an overall lack of depth in character development, the movie failed to deliver a compelling story. Additionally, the dubbed version only accentuated the poor quality, making it feel even more cheesy and juvenile, leaving viewers unimpressed and disinterested."
What were your thoughts on the character development in this movie?,"Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). I was very disappointed.","The character development was extremely lacking in this film, with shallow and uninteresting personalities that made it hard to root for any of them. The dialogue felt forced, and it was difficult to connect with the characters on any meaningful level."
Did this movie live up to the hype at WorldFest?,This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards.<br /><br />,"This movie was a major disappointment at WorldFest, lacking originality, emotional depth, and featuring a predictable storyline. The acting felt lackluster and the main character was unsympathetic, making it a boring watch. The presence of well-known actors like J.Beals didn't save the film from being deemed as one of the worst seen at the festival."
Do you think the movie effectively portrays the cutthroat nature of the entertainment industry?,"Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence. I wouldn't say blood-soaked; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo(John Cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen, but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after. There is always a producer's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition...Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shot away. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, that's show business...or is it?","Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire attempts to blend humor with violence, but falls short of making a compelling impact. The storyline lacks depth and the characters fail to evoke genuine empathy or interest from the audience. Max Matteo's character comes across as one-dimensional and his descent into obsession feels forced and predictable. Despite the star-studded cast, including John Cassini, Molly Parker, and Jennifer Beals, the performances fail to elevate the weak script. Overall, the film fails to deliver a convincing portrayal of the competitive world of showbiz."
What made this movie so disappointing?,"It's like a bad 80s TV show got loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my god was it bad. The plots of each character had little relevance. The plot itself wasn't anything to speak of. Something about a stalker, I guess. In the end he shoots himself? It's not really clear, but somehow there's a volleyball game involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps around a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it, which were barely watchable at that. Thank god I didn't spend any money on it, but I want that hour of my life back.","This movie felt like a confused mess, with irrelevant character plots and a lackluster main storyline. The attempt to blend elements of a stalker storyline with a volleyball game was awkward and the main character's promiscuity felt forced. Even the presence of Casper Van Dien couldn't save this film from being barely watchable. The overall experience left viewers feeling like they wasted their time and had little to no entertainment value."
What makes Kill Shot a standout movie in the volleyball genre?,"The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. Thankfully, highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (rated lower than Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, don't let the cover of this movie decieve you. Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using such high-tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji is able to aid FBI agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the movie, including brief cameos by Denise Richards, a gay negro, and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl, Koji carries this movie on his own. Any fan of movies such as The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.","The plot of Kill Shot, despite being led by the talented actor Koji, falls flat with a lackluster script and unconvincing performances by supporting actors like Denise Richards. Additionally, the use of outdated technology in the film makes it difficult for viewers to suspend disbelief and fully engage with the storyline."
"What made you believe this movie was really bad?
Negative","Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie!""","This movie was a huge disappointment. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, the acting was wooden, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. It felt like a waste of time and money."
What are some cons of the movie?,"Man, this was hilarious. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier. Seriously? I want anyone associated with this movie tased, effective immediately. For everyone who is thinking of watching this ""movie"", let''s go over a few plot points. Oh, wait. There aren't any. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and he decided to film something with some random someones, and miraculously, it somehow got on videotape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Don't believe me? Go watch it. Do it, man. I dare you. But be prepared to gouge your eyes out. If you can sit through this without blowing a cow, you are very strong and courageous.","The movie lacks any coherent plot and seems like it was randomly put together without any substance. The humor falls flat, making it an unbearable experience to sit through. The performances come off as uninspired, with Casper Van Dien seemingly uninterested in the project. It's hard to understand how this movie even got made, let alone how anyone could find it entertaining."
What are some major drawbacks of the movie according to a viewer?,"Saw this on TV. I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental. The movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner, to the snaking electric cables. The plot is really weak and unbelievable - the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a 20 foot wave of bone breaking avalanche (using actual footage) and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down. The avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road.<br /><br />Some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even flimsier.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, don't bother with this one not even on T.V.","The movie is totally predictable with a weak and unbelievable plot. The avalanche scenes, although impressive, fail to make up for the overall flimsiness of the film. The contrast between the real and staged footage further highlights the movie's shortcomings. The viewer advises against watching this one, even on TV."
What makes this movie stand out among others?,"I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad. It's like the TV station are desperate for anything, anything at all. They're buried underneath a bunch of snow, the electricity constantly flashes on and off, yet magically there is a background light that stays constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That, and all that stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping. But because it's such bad directing and acting, you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick, sorry. I'm joining the negative feedback, and I concur that this is one of the worst movies ever.","This movie stands out for all the wrong reasons. The unrealistic lighting inconsistencies, lackluster acting and constant bickering among characters make it one of the worst movies ever made. It fails to create a sense of urgency or genuine camaraderie, leaving viewers feeling like they wasted their time watching it."
What are some examples of better movies with similar humor?,"A one is the highest rating I could have given this movie, considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew, pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work, written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns, and poop and fart jokes. For example, Gene Stapelton's (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) character telling Marilu Henner's character that she ""swings both ways"" sexually, was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie... You want good, cheeky humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (part one only), Old School or Office Space.",
"Was ""Love In the Time of Money"" able to keep the audience engaged throughout the film?","This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a ""motion"" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same ""story"" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching ""Love In the Time of Money"", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people walk out before me.",This movie was incredibly boring with no real storyline or engaging characters. It failed to capture the audience's attention and left many viewers walking out before it even reached the climax.
What was the most disappointing aspect of this movie?,"Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all.<br /><br />The film shows promise for Ustinov is released from prison for embezzling. He convinces Robert Morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo for films.<br /><br />Morley sounds just as he did in 1938's ""Marie Antoinette."" Perhaps, he needed to return to that genre.<br /><br />This film is ridiculous at best. Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering Oscar performance in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.""<br /><br />Ms. Smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb-red head, but by film's end, she is the brains of the outfit. Too bad the writing didn't go the way with her.","Despite having a talented cast including Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov, the film failed to deliver a compelling story and instead presented a ridiculous plot. The character development felt inconsistent, especially with Maggie Smith's portrayal starting off as seemingly unintelligent but suddenly becoming the intelligence behind the operation. The overall execution of the film fell short of its potential, leaving viewers questioning the direction it took."
What were some shortcomings of the film?,"A reasonable effort is summary for this film. A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given, other actors were just dreadful! A terrible portrayal. It wasn't very funny and so it didn't really achieve its genres as it wasn't particularly funny and it wasn't dramatic. The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance. Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn't as good and who the target audiences were etc. However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability.<br /><br />4.","The movie lacked a sense of achievement, the actors, besides Maggie Smith, were dreadful in their portrayal. It failed to be funny or dramatic, missing the mark with its genres. The target audience was not reached, leading to confusing messages. The plot and storyline were basic and not well executed, leaving viewers puzzled about the film's quality and target audience."
What elements of the film did the reviewer find concerning?,"I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I am a film student at the Univeristy of Michigan so I know a thing or two about film. And Crispin Glover's film is outrageous. He basically exploits the mentally challenged. Not only is Shirly Temple the anti-Christ (which I admit is a little funny) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are, mentally challenged. PETA and Human Rights should be all over this thing. It's not 'counter-culture' as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.","The reviewer expressed disappointment and shock at the film's portrayal of mentally challenged individuals, describing it as exploitative and in poor taste. They criticized the use of disturbing themes like encouraging violence among the mentally challenged and the obsession with killing snails. Additionally, the reviewer raised concerns about the inappropriate romantic subplot involving one of the actors with disabilities. Overall, they felt that the film failed to offer genuine counter-culture commentary and instead resorted to exploitation."
"What kind of movie is ""What Is It?""","What Is It? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas, and overtly racist music, among others) unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me as self-consciously ""freak show,"" and I don't mean only the unusual casting decisions. It has the feel of a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead (my second-least-favorite film of all time), which was by intent much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind -- even someone else's chemically altered consciousness -- but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness.","""What Is It?"" is a jumbled mess of random elements like snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas, and offensive music. The lack of a coherent plot or character development made it feel like a pretentious freak show. It resembles a bad acid trip, similar to the depressive tone of Eraserhead. Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of time, offering weird visuals without any substance or purpose."
What aspects of the animated Inspector Gadget movie were disappointing?,"this animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame.the story is very weak,and there is little action.most of the characters are given little to nothing to do.the movie is mildly entertaining at best,but really doesn't go any where and is pointless.it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated TV show from the 80's.it's not a movie that bears repeat viewing,at least in my mind.it's only about 74 minutes long including credits,so i guess that's a good thing.unlike in the TV show,the characters are not worth rooting for here.in the show,you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day,but there,who really cares?anyway,that's just my opinion.for me Inspector Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing 3/10","The animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame overall. The story is weak, lacking action, and most characters are underdeveloped. It is mildly entertaining at best, but ultimately goes nowhere and feels pointless. Comparing to the 80's TV show, the movie falls short drastically. The characters lack depth, making it difficult to root for them. It's just not worth a repeat viewing and overall a disappointing watch, earning it a 3/10 rating."
What are some of the unsettling and inappropriate themes depicted in the movie?,"Dear Friends and Family,<br /><br />I guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen, then that's their eternal damnation - just remember kids, ""birth control"" doesn't mean ""oral sex"", I don't care what the honor student says. On the other hand, even if the senator's aid quotes himself as a ""bit of a romantic guy"", he's still only hitting on a high school girl. If she was my sister, I'd eat this guys kneecaps.<br /><br />Other than that I found out that Mongolians don't kiss the same way the French do and that baseball players named Zoo like delicate undergarments.<br /><br />I think I'd almost rather watch Richie Rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip, slap, slop. Thank you, and good night.","The movie seems to glamorize inappropriate relationships between teenagers and adults, and includes uncomfortable jokes about birth control and sexual interactions. These themes are not suitable for a younger audience and may leave viewers feeling disturbed rather than entertained."
"What are some aspects of ""The Bagman"" that may disappoint viewers expecting a typical low-budget, B-movie experience?","Any film with a title as ridiculous as ""The Bagman"" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is far different than what one may expect after viewing the DVD cover. The Bagman is by no means a good movie. It falls into the category of films that seem to have been (and probably were) filmed on a home video camera. The acting is awful. I haven't heard and seen such wooden acting since Troll 2. There are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumped into too fast. The characters are morons and entirely forgettable. The ending (which I will not spoil) can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene. Due to the cheesy nature of the film, nothing aside from the awful production values is truly scary (awful attempts at realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc). Recommended for bad movie aficionados only.","The acting in ""The Bagman"" is incredibly wooden and unconvincing, reminiscent of a poorly made home video. The plot is predictable from the very beginning, leaving little room for surprises. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, making it hard for viewers to feel invested in the story. Additionally, the attempts at creating scares through cheesy production values fall flat, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience."
"What are some critical shortcomings of the movie ""Switching Goals""?",i saw switching goals ..twice....and always the same feeling...you see the Olsen twins make same movie....they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys..OK now about the movie....first off all such little boys and girls don't play on such big goals...2.football does not play on time outs...3.if the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime (a minute or more)...and the finish is so foreseen....i think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledgement....if it were done by European producers it would be better..and also the mane actors aren't the wright choice...they suffer from lack of authentic..OK they played some seasons in full house but that doesn't make them big stars....you have got to show your talent....and that is what is missing in the Olsen twins,"The movie ""Switching Goals"" lacks authenticity in its portrayal of football, with unrealistic scenarios such as little boys and girls playing on oversized goals and incorrect game rules like timeouts in football. The predictability of the plot and the lack of football knowledge among the main actors, the Olsen twins, contribute to the overall disappointment of the film. It is suggested that better production by European producers and more talented actors could have improved the quality of the movie."
What were some of the shortcomings of the movie that disappointed you as a viewer?,"I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /><br />I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 mins. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this...","The movie lacked the intense character development and drama that I was hoping for. Daniel-Day Lewis' performance felt repetitive, and I would rate it a 6 out of 10. The direction and script were subpar, with ratings of 5 out of 10 and 2 out of 10 respectively. Overall, the movie failed to engage me, and I ended up deleting it from my DVR after just 70 minutes."
Was the movie COLLISION COURSE able to successfully deliver on its pairing of Jay Leno and Pat Morita?,"The novelty of hearing clean-cut Jay Leno spout four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched-police-partners caper. In COLLISION COURSE, the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot?). The two leads try hard, they really do, but Leno is no actor and Morita's fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry. The film carries a bit of cheesy '80s appeal, but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100-minute running time. Fans of Leno's considerable comedic talents will feel let down; everyone else will just be bored.","The only highlight of COLLISION COURSE was hearing Jay Leno swear, while the rest of the movie felt formulaic and lacking. Despite the efforts of the two lead actors, Leno's lack of acting skills and Morita's stereotypical fish-out-of-water character made the film tedious to watch. The '80s vibe of the movie only provided minimal entertainment value, and as the film dragged on for an unbearable 100 minutes, even fans of Leno's comedy were left disappointed, with most viewers feeling bored throughout."
What makes this movie fall short as an action comedy film?,"This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. He is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started about the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.","This movie lacks the action, humor, and chemistry between the main characters that are essential for a successful action comedy. Jay Leno's attempts at acting tough are unconvincing, his one-liners are not funny, and his running scenes are unpleasant to watch. Pat Morita's portrayal may also be seen as culturally insensitive. The story is also lacking, resulting in a disappointing overall experience, earning it a low rating of 2 out of 10."
What inaccuracies and disappointments might viewers encounter in this film?,"Richard Dreyfuss is, indeed, in this flick, but in a rather small part. He is NOT the ""obsessed"" filmmaker - he's the group's business manager/accountant. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless one uses the term ""erotic"" quite loosely. I would not have considered viewing the film without Richard Dreyfuss being in it as a major character. I might have, however, had I realized that the famous 60's anthem, Leonard Cohen's ""Suzanne,"" was an artistic influence. Other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of James Joyce's ""Ulysses"", and an interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal,"" I found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like ""Last Year at Marianbad"" and ""Un Chien Andalou."" If you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe, there are many superior films, ranging from ""Bye, Bye, Brasil"" to ""Cecil B. Demented.""","Viewers might be disappointed by the inaccuracies in the film's description, such as Richard Dreyfuss's role being misrepresented and the absence of the erotic scenes with Sondra Locke as advertised. The attempt to merge symbolic elements and artistic influences may fall short compared to other films that do it better."
"What are viewers saying about the cinematography and dialogue in ""The Second Coming Of Suzanne""?","""The Second Coming Of Suzanne"" is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated, yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other movies of this type, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot. However, the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention.<br /><br />The video box states that this film is ""one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film."" Yeah...sure. It's right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile. 1/10",
What are some of the criticisms of the movie?,"Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20 second cameos and what is Gene Barry doing all over this movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever. The inept writer/director (same dude) butchered up everyone's talent with his horrendous uh...work. I got the DVD for a penny so can't complain! But it's weird!And it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way. This was the 70's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be inside his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly plays foul. It has that ""Manson family on acid"" vibe to it.<br /><br />I have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie? Maybe they worked in it back when? At any rate, be prepared to lose 80+ min of your life you'll never get back. Yes, it's that awful!","The movie is a confusing mess with nonsensical plot, bizarre characters, and a director who failed to utilize the talented cast. The film feels like a product of a bad acid trip from the 70s and leaves viewers feeling uncomfortable in a negative way. The supposedly interesting and controversial concept falls flat, resembling a scratched record that disappoints quickly. The overall experience of watching this movie is a waste of time, with the potential to leave viewers feeling regretful and unfulfilled."
What were your thoughts on the overall acting performances in the movie?,"This movie was exactly what I expected it to be when i first read the casting. I probably could have written a more exciting plot, it's a pity that they left it to a pack of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank God (and we too) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living. He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very good on mainland without his skis... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and that's all. She obviously wasn't chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs. Nevertheless I must admit that she could be the Tomba's acting teacher, because he's even a worse actor than her, and that's funny, especially considering that she isn't italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.","The acting in this movie was incredibly lackluster, with Alberto Tomba and Michelle Hunziker failing to deliver convincing performances. Tomba's acting skills were particularly disappointing as he struggled to emote or engage with the audience. Hunziker, on the other hand, seemed to be chosen more for her looks than her acting abilities, resulting in a shallow and unconvincing portrayal. Their lack of chemistry on screen made it hard to invest in their characters, turning what could have been an engaging plot into a laughable mess."
"Was the movie ""Alex L'Ariete"" well-received by the audience? 

Negative","Probably somebody heard of Alberto Tomba. A former policeman, a former sky champion, and, now, a TERRIBLE actor. ""Alex L'Ariete"" was planned to be a TV ""mini serial"", but the Italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels. Now it's a, believe me, ridiculous movie. The script it's simply hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 years old kid work. But what really blows you away it's the amateurish acting: Alberto Tomba, who actually was not believable as a policeman himself, plays terribly a totally silly character: a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open! (""ariete"" is ""ram""). This super-guy will try to save a young nice girl life (an actual italian ""little"" TV showgirl, married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti): nice but absolutely inept in the acting. Lose this one and make yourself a favour. A movie that is a shame to Italian cinema industry: only John Travolta in Earth Attack got close..","Alberto Tomba's transition from a former ski champion to an actor in ""Alex L'Ariete"" proves to be a disastrous move. The script lacks depth, resembling the work of a child, and the acting is unconvincing and amateurish. The film's attempt at drama falls flat, with ridiculous scenes and a lack of believability in the characters. Overall, ""Alex L'Ariete"" is a shameful addition to the Italian cinema industry and is best avoided by viewers."
"What is the most redeeming quality of the movie ""Prince of the Sun"" according to the review?","This is the worst piece of crap I have seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is plain stupid, dialogs don't make any sense, humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor. Actors just don't play, the worse they don't even try. The script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this flick, the fights. They are well choreographed as one would expect of the Hong Kong guys, and are the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun. Although I believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn't have to bother thinking about the storyline. However, this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end. Avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock.","According to the review, the movie ""Prince of the Sun"" falls flat in almost every aspect. The plot is criticized as stupid, the dialogues make no sense, the humor doesn't land, and the actors' performances are lackluster. The only saving grace highlighted in the review is the well-choreographed fight scenes, attributed to the Hong Kong style, which are the sole enjoyable aspect of the film. However, even these fights are seen as mere distractions from the weak and absurd plot, making the movie overall a disappointment and one to avoid unless you specifically enjoy the work of actress Cynthia Rothrock."
What were some drawbacks of this episode of Tom and Jerry?,"Jerry spies Tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis.<br /><br />I didn't find this particular episode that funny: the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame (Jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' in this one, tormenting poor Tom for no particular reason).<br /><br />There is the occasional flash of inspiration (such as Tom's literal 'heart in mouth' experience, and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body), but, on the whole, this effort lacks the frenetic pacing, excellent animation and sheer wit of most of T&J's other cartoons.","The humor felt constrained and the set up was kind of lame, making Jerry seem like the 'bad guy' tormenting Tom for no reason. While there were some moments of inspiration, overall it lacked the fast-paced energy, great animation, and cleverness seen in other Tom and Jerry cartoons."
Can you share your thoughts on the film?,This movie was extremely boring. It should least not more than 15 minutes. The images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing.<br /><br />Usually I don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments. I think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title.<br /><br />What more can I say? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period. I think it is the point itself.<br /><br />There is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end.<br /><br />When you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again.,"This movie was extremely boring and seemed to drag on for what felt like eternity. The scenes depicting violence towards children and animals were particularly unsettling. It lacked meaningful dialogue between characters and failed to capture and maintain the audience's attention, with many viewers admitting to falling asleep multiple times during its lengthy runtime."
What are some aspects of the movie that failed to impress the viewer?,"This was really a very bad movie. I am a huge fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two 'Demons' films to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really, really bad. It is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife slapping husband and whiny cry-baby pain in the *** wife drove me mad, there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the Ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film. I turned it off about three quarters of the way through because I was very, very BORED! Don't bother.","The movie was a huge disappointment for viewers who enjoy Italian Horror films, lacking the entertainment value and charm of classics by directors like Argento and Fulci. The storyline was uninteresting, the characters were unlikable, and the lack of focus on the intriguing character of the Ogre was a missed opportunity. Overall, the movie was so bad that it failed to keep the viewer engaged and was deemed incredibly boring."
Do you recommend watching this movie?,"This production has absolutely no storyline. The acting is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV. Her acting is far from flawless and personally I think she has crossed boundary of professional decency; relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie. This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands (as most movies do). Do not bother to watch this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen.","This movie lacks a coherent storyline, features embarrassing acting, and includes an excessive amount of unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes, and rude language. The portrayal of the Netherlands in the movie is also misleading. It would be advisable to skip this film as it is a waste of time, money, and tarnishes the professional reputation of the lead actress, Sophie Hilbrand."
"What are the main drawbacks of the film ""Gojoe""?","Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a scion of the Genji clan. The film-making has the main hallmarks of a low-budget production, including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages (the kind you might find in an under-produced dorama). The monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards Gojoe bridge at night, but he doesn't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time - but which could earn him enlightenment. <br /><br />There's no absence of ambitiousness, however, in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly. Artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film-making style. <br /><br />A disappointment.","The film suffers from low-budget production values, with blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages reminiscent of an under-produced dorama. While ambitious in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly, the film falls short in execution and overall quality, leading to a disappointing viewing experience."
Did the film accurately portray historical figures from the period?,"I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event . Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film , probably the most intriquing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger , ditto , and Bloody Bill Anderson , who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script. Instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about. how sad. The costumes were wonderful however, as was the location shooting in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another film from the period and try again, or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on .","The film failed to explore crucial historical figures like Wm C Quantrill, Frank James, Cole Younger, and Bloody Bill Anderson, opting instead for underdeveloped fictitious characters. It missed an opportunity to delve into the fascinating and rich material of the time period, leaving the audience disappointed in the lack of depth in character development."
"Can you share your thoughts on the movie ""Ride With the Devil""?","This was a new alltime low among westerns. The writing is excruciatingly bad, characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed. And Tobey Maguire shows us the flip side of his talent, sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism. 'Ride With the Devil' is among my five worst movie experiences ever, a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect.","This was a new all-time low among westerns. The writing is excruciatingly bad, characters are impossible to empathize with, and are either disgusting or bland. The violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed. Tobey Maguire's performance feels lackluster, as he sleepwalks through his part with expressionless eyes and a raspy voice that comes off as mere mannerism. Overall, ""Ride With the Devil"" is among my five worst movie experiences ever, a western that falls short in every negative aspect."
"What are some of the criticisms of the movie ""Rob Roy""?","How does a Scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather? Very,very carefully.Now I have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that I was born in Scotland.Far too many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously.It's a joke,people,""four legs good - two legs bad"",as Orwell had it. Jessica Lange has an accent that the Wells - next - the - sea Amateur Dramatic Society's production of ""Brigadoon"" would turn down. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose Great Grandmama once stepped off the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And the Auld Enemy?Where would the Scots be without them to hate and blame for everything?Messrs Roth,Cox and Hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping. ""Robin Hood - Prince of thieves"" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison.And at least Alan Rickman was funny.","The film is criticized for perpetuating simplistic stereotypes about Scottish culture and its characters, with exaggerated accents and lack of authenticity. The performances of the actors, especially Jessica Lange and Liam Neeson, are deemed unconvincing and lacking depth. The portrayal of the English characters as villains is seen as clichéd and contributes to a shallow narrative. Overall, the film is faulted for its reliance on tired tropes and missed opportunities for genuine storytelling."
What were some of the aspects of the movie that disappointed you?,"Born, raised, and educated in Scotland, I was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler. Worse yet, the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another, by implication or verbally. To view it, one would think that 18th century Scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke acting as the ""young"" mother at age 49 but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a ""bath"" in a Scottish loch is NOT commonplace as they portrayed him - but, it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were. Save your money and watch Pinnochio.","The portrayal of the characters as cattle rustlers and the excessive focus on sexual themes were off-putting. The inaccurate depiction of 18th-century Scotland as a land filled with sexual deviants was distasteful. The performances by the actors, especially Jessica Lange and Liam Neeson, were lackluster and unbelievable. The scenes featuring Neeson bathing in a Scottish loch felt forced and did not contribute positively to the story. This movie should be avoided, and viewers would be better off watching something like Pinocchio."
Was this movie a satisfying watch overall?,"This movie was a long build-up with no climax. People whom refer to the swordfight in the end as great must either be out of their minds, or have none. Way too often this movie got soft. I am not saying that soft movies are bad. But no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a T-bone steak. This movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture, but it ended up being a petty bar-brawl. And there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was; Tim Roth's character (and yes, he plays him well). Rob Roy was a weak ""hero"" with no knowledge of how to use a sword, and the way he ""won"" was a disgrace. As a drama this movie had it's periods, but the best performance in it has to go the nature of Scotland. This is one tad breath short of being termed as ""soap"" in my book.","This movie fell short in delivering a compelling storyline, despite the potential for an engaging revenge plot. The build-up throughout the film failed to lead to a satisfying climax, leaving viewers feeling underwhelmed. The swordfight scenes, which are typically a highlight in similar movies, were lackluster and failed to impress. The protagonist, Rob Roy, lacked the necessary skills to be convincing as a hero seeking vengeance, resulting in a lack of authenticity in the character's actions. Overall, the film missed the mark in delivering a captivating and believable narrative, ultimately making it less enjoyable to watch."
What are some major flaws that detract from the movie's potential impact?,"Here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending. Conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes. It would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life. Brent, as usual, is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of Gig Young playing a character named Gig Young. Someone mentions ""Gig Young"" and then who appears but Gig Young, the actor! Worth seeing though far below what it could have been.","Despite its potential, the movie falls short due to the rushed resolution of conflicts, a jarring character development for Barbara Stanwyck, and a bizarre casting choice that takes away from the authenticity of the film."
What aspect of the film disappointed the reviewer?,"From the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes Keanu ""I'm so wooden I could be a Plank me"" Reeves look like an Oscar winner this film bites (pun not intended). The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist'). Wish I'd spent the £3.99 it cost me on something else, like erm.... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you do buy this, you're really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead. However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta:The werewolf Hunt.","The film was heavily criticized for its blocky digitised footage and lackluster acting, with comparisons made to Keanu Reeves' wooden performances. The reviewer expressed regret over spending money on the film and recommended avoiding it entirely, particularly pointing out the lack of quality in the actors' performances and the overall amateurish feel."
Were the attempted philosophical elements in the movie captivating and intellectually stimulating?,"I won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive I felt like I just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma. Some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but couldn't hold up the rest. I felt like I was stoned for the first time again, having semi-philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents.<br /><br />What a futile attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights. I'd rather watch Jesus is een Palestijn, without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor, also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves.<br /><br />Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and appearantly never will be.","Some scenes showed promise in playing with visual dimensions, but overall, the attempt to create a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma fell flat. The movie felt like a futile attempt to elevate Dutch cinema to new heights, lacking the depth and impact expected. Comparisons to renowned filmmakers like Jean-Luc Godard and Tarkovsky highlight the movie's shortcomings in delivering a truly thought-provoking experience."
What are some of the reasons why Men In White fails as a parody movie?,"Although properly warned I actually sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give every movie an even break, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. I stand corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did I laugh. Namely during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny. And some of them you actually see coming a mile away. This movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. none of the above. To call this movie bad would be a gross understatement. AVOID THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!","The movie Men In White is an absolute disaster in the realm of comedy. Despite the presence of talented actors like George Kennedy and Barry Bostwick, the film falls flat on its face with lackluster jokes and predictable punchlines. Unlike classic parody movies such as Airplane! and Scary Movie, Men In White lacks any memorable gags, witty dialogue, or quotable lines. The attempt at humor is so poor that the only saving grace is perhaps a single chuckle-worthy moment during the Simon says scene. Avoid this movie at all costs as it fails to deliver on any front of what makes a good parody film."
Why did the film fail to capture the essence of humor and ended up being a disaster?,"This film is so bad, it made me want to vomit. Poorly produced, a complete laugh free zone. Why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof (and a damn funny one at that) as it stands? The sets are laughable, the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable, and the acting farcical. It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage. National Lampoon once made Animal House, which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious. Now they've been relegated to making TV movies like this lump of ****. Name your expletive, and it could be accurately used to describe this film.","This movie is a complete disaster, it failed to capture any essence of humor, making it a cringe-worthy and painful experience to watch. The production quality was extremely poor, lacking any semblance of comedic timing which left the audience wanting to cringe instead of laugh. The sets were poorly made, the special effects were laughably bad, and the acting was completely over-the-top and farcical. It's truly baffling why anyone would waste their time watching this absolute garbage of a film, especially coming from a production company that once created comedy gold like Animal House."
What makes this film so horrendous that it triggers such strong negative emotions in the reviewer?,"I may have seen worse films than this, but I if I have, I don't remember. Or possibly blocked them out. Who knows,if I was to undergo hypnotherapy, I may remember them, along, maybe, with been abducted by aliens as a child, or other traumas. If so, I would happily exchange those memories for the ones I have of watching this film.<br /><br />I should give the film some credit: It did produce an emotional response. I actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and TV programs, that this travesty was dirtying them by association. I am terrified that I may be unable to watch films like Dr Strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye.","This movie seems to be a total disaster, causing the reviewer to feel angry and disappointed throughout the viewing experience. The film's attempt at humor by spoofing other well-loved films and shows only serves to tarnish the original works, leaving the audience feeling jaded and disillusioned. It might be best to steer clear of this movie for a more enjoyable cinematic experience."
What's the worst movie-watching experience you've ever had?,"I watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on, it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful. I urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be, surely it was deliberate. I cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish, unrehearsed, badly executed way that it was beyond belief. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, think I am exaggerating? Well give it airtime and think again. Dreadful, utterly dreadful. If this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again.","It was simply unbearable. The attempts at humor were so poorly executed that it was cringe-worthy. The movie was dreadful, beyond belief, and made even terrible movies seem like cinematic masterpieces in comparison. The director and everyone involved should be removed for subjecting viewers to such a painfully awful film."
"What did you think of the movie ""Movie""?<br />","This 'Movie' has to be the biggest pile of steaming C*^p I have ever<br /><br />seen, What more can I say than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is NOTHING to save this 'movie' and I pray that they NEVER even talk about making a sequel. If you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth. Movies like Men in Black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this 'Comedy' but have TOTALLY failed. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).","This movie is absolutely dreadful, a complete waste of time. It's a pathetic attempt at comedy with a ridiculous storyline that makes no sense. The humor falls flat, the characters are poorly developed, and it's a blatant rip-off of much better movies like Men in Black. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this train wreck."
"What were some of the major drawbacks of the movie ""The Flock"" according to a viewer?","I watched the movie ""The Flock"" because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the WORST movies I've seen in a long while (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never posted online before but this movie was so awful I had to do so. I suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it's unbelievable. The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it's nauseating. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As for the Gere/Danes on screen matchup, because of the horrible writing, one doesn't believe either character for a single minute. I'll bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative, were such a thing possible. It's a shame to see talent wasted so badly, not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back. (I know what you're thinking. How do I really feel?)","One viewer expressed deep disappointment in ""The Flock,"" citing the poor script as the major culprit. They found the story nonsensical and the dialogue nauseatingly trite. The reviewer felt that even seasoned actors like Gere and Danes couldn't salvage the film due to the terrible writing, making the on-screen pairing unbelievable. Overall, the viewer regretted wasting their time on this movie and highlighted the evident waste of talent in a poorly executed production."
"What are some criticisms of the movie ""The Flock"" based on positive reviews?","The reasons to watch this knock off... err... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - Someone pays you to watch it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pop in the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes, or put it in your Netflix cue and skip The Flock entirely. The Flock the same story with with a few changes. Furthermore the editing just wreaks of Se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. The worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people people chattering over the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.<br /><br />Bottom line: I call it a blatant knock off. If you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film, go ahead, but either way go watch Se7en.","The film ""The Flock"" is criticized for being a blatant knockoff or tribute film to the much superior ""Se7en."" Reviewers point out that the similarities in the story and editing are distracting, with the helicopter shots and radio sounds feeling out of place and taking away from the viewing experience. Ultimately, viewers are advised to skip ""The Flock"" and opt for watching ""Se7en"" instead for a better movie night."
Who is the target audience for this movie?,"I really have problems rating this movie. It is directed brilliantly, there is obviously a lot of money in it. Gere and Danes are intense (although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes, and, yes, one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire.<br /><br />In purely artistic terms, it is a 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie ....","The movie is directed brilliantly and well-acted by Gere and Danes, but it is concerning how the excessive violence and disturbing scenes might influence viewers. It raises questions about why such a film was made and who it was made for. The over-the-top nature of the movie may leave audiences feeling uneasy and disturbed rather than entertained."
What are some aspects of the film that might turn viewers off?,"I saw this film last night (about 102 minutes) and don't know what kept me in my seat. I guess I just expected a film with Gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen. The story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture. There is not a character in the film that does anything like real life. The cutting ""style"" relies on jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and SURPRISE the leader is the ""victim"" of an executed killer. I don't see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this violent, sexist trash.","The film fails to deliver any semblance of value, instead opting for a constant barrage of bondage and torture scenes with characters that feel entirely disconnected from reality. The excessive use of jump cuts and flashy editing techniques do little to salvage the vapid storyline, making it a disappointing watch even for fans of the lead actor."
What are some of the major flaws in this movie that the reviewer mentions?,"I have been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old, beginning with Childs Play.Since then, I have seen good horror movies and bad, but this is without question, the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen! The actors did all they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus , it was just all gore. I can stomach a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines! Plain Stupid! Another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of it is just dumb. But then again, it goes with the rest of it! At the end, when the girl gets away from the cannibal/ancestor, she receives help from a old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she turns around to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She turned into a cannibal! Retarded movie.","The reviewer criticizes the movie for having a dumb and idiotic plot, excessive gore with ridiculous scenes, slow pace, and a nonsensical ending."
"What are some of the biggest weaknesses in the movie, particularly when it comes to the characters and dialogue delivery?","First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she's just awful. This movie has every horror move cliché in imagination, and all badly played. The over-sexed teen couple. The comical(not)horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The creepy local color guy. The parental-type couple. The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago, but somehow, this just got worse. Sure, the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs.","The characters in the movie are stereotypical and poorly executed, with Jenna Jameson failing to impress in her role. The dialogue is cringeworthy and lacks depth, making you wish for the characters to meet their demise sooner rather than later. The film is filled with overused horror clichés that are badly portrayed, leaving the viewer disappointed and frustrated. The humor in the movie falls flat, with the only somewhat amusing moment being a ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants. Overall, this movie is a complete letdown and should be avoided at all costs."
What are some major drawbacks of the film?,"This started bad, got worse, and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end i literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed it off and choke the C**T to death with it. Avoid this film, a little bit of good cinematography and some naked shots, would be almost acceptable if i was 14 and had not seen Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If anyone feels the need to watch this film, i would strongly recommend you spend the time more appropriately, as an example i would say trying to cram a Lego house into your bum with no lube would be a good start. I hear that this film was not the original version, i would very much like to view the original, as it seems that this cut version is devoid of all plot, and apparently most of the nudity, can someone please tell me how i can get in touch with Christian Viel he owes me an hour of my life back!","The film was deemed as a complete waste of time by a viewer who expressed extreme disappointment in the lack of depth in the plot and the seemingly unnecessary explicit scenes. The viewer went as far as wanting to physically harm the person who recommended the film, which showcases the level of frustration it brought. The lack of coherence in the storyline and the absence of engaging elements left the viewer feeling like they had endured a torturous experience."
What was your overall impression of the movie?,"I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is...my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this. Not the worst acting I've ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired. There wasn't a single 'scare' moment in the movie, with the exception of when they were watching the movie 'Halloween' on the TV. All around, it seems like it could've been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I could've said 'oh yeah, there she is'. I'm so glad I saw this in a hotel and didn't pay for it as I'd be real ticked if I had payed a cent to see this. I normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even that amusing so-good-it's-bad....it's just plain bad.","The movie was so bad that the reviewer had to go out of their way to express how awful it was. The storyline was compared to a cat playing with a ball of string, indicating how lackluster it was. The sudden elimination of most of the cast early on was disappointing, and there were no scary moments except for a scene from another movie. The reviewer felt that the potential for a good story was wasted, and even the appearance of a recognizable actor was easily missed. Overall, the reviewer regretted watching the movie and felt it was a complete waste of time."
Why was this film considered the worst movie ever seen?<br />,"Thanks to this film, I now can answer the question, ""What is the worst movie you have ever seen?""<br /><br />I can't even think of a close second, and I've seen some really bad movies.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing works in this film. Name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here's some typical dialogue:<br /><br />""Steve?"" ""Steve?"" ""Steve, is that you?"" ""Steve, I'm not kidding"" ""Steve, this isn't funny!"" ""Steve, are you there?"" ""Steve?"" ""Steve?"" ""Steve?""<br /><br />""ARggh!!!! Ahhhhhh!!!! Nooooooo!""","This film is a complete disaster with nothing redeeming about it. From poor acting to cliched dialogue, it fails at every aspect as a horror film. It's so terrible that even YouTube videos seem better in comparison."
Would you consider watching a movie featuring four porn stars in the Irish woods?,"Four porn stars romping through the Irish woods sounds like a film to watch. We have Ginger Lynn Allen, Chasey Lain, Taylor Hayes, and Jenna Jameson all together in one film. Are you licking your lips? Well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victims.<br /><br />Yes, there was some flesh exposed - far too little considering the cast - but, it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures. There was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before, and more than one person lost their head in the situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, director Christian Viel did not show much promise and I am not likely to watch his later efforts.","The movie features gratuitous violence and gore, with mediocre direction leaving much to be desired."
What are some drawbacks of this movie?,please don't rent or even think about buying this movie.they don't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a $1 & i think its worth less than that.the main reason why i rented this d movie was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min.i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know.Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna & she's not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name.i recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see Jenna almost throughout the whole movie & nude most of the time.this movie is a big disappointment & such a huge waste of time.,"The movie is a big disappointment, not even available at Redbox to rent. It's worth less than the $1 rental price, with minimal acting time for the main actress Jenna Jameson. Despite some nudity, it's a huge waste of time with better options available like Zombie Strippers."
What makes this comedy horror flick fail to impress an audience?,"I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.","This ridiculously titled comedy horror flick falls flat with its unimpressive plot borrowed from other well-known horror movies like THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN, lacking the intensity and scares it attempts to deliver. The lone mutant character fails to make a lasting impression, and the film feels amateurish and tedious throughout, culminating in a predictable and overused ending that leaves viewers underwhelmed. Overall, the movie is a missed opportunity for genuine horror and entertainment."
What aspect of the movie did the reviewer feel really detracted from their enjoyment?,"MAKE A 0 YOU SACKS OF German STAPLES! well, when i started to watch this sack of crud, it was a Sunday afternoon, and i was just looking for stuff on show time. I was introduced to a hot naked babe, and like any guy (im a guy, the e-mail is my sisters...) i was happy. But then they threw it all to the dogs, spit on it, lit it on fire, and peed it out. You wanna know how? THE DUMB CHICK TALKED! The dialog throughout the film was just horrible. sounded like something my 2nd grade bro could wright. The violence was nice for some scenes, but some was just totally moronic. The scene in the pit were he gives the guy the knife... dumb moron! To sum it up, this is pure cinema barf drenched in the chocolate syrup known as nudity, and topped with the cherry of horrible acting as only a porn star could deliver.","The reviewer found the dialogues in the movie to be awful, comparable to something a second grader could write, and criticized the violence as being sometimes moronic. Additionally, they expressed disappointment in the acting, describing it as horrible."
"Is the film a total disaster in terms of audiovisual quality and editing?

Negative","Did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what?!?<br /><br />Sound effects, background music and the editing in general was so bad you'd think some 12-year-old wanna-be made the film.<br /><br />Most of the acting was good considering the script... the ""innocent virgin"" played her part really well.<br /><br />The mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel... but, unfortunately for all involved, that's not the case.<br /><br />Turn Left was made better than this movie and those guys didn't even have any money!!! Good thing I didn't rent the movie myself!","The sound effects, background music, and editing in the movie are so poorly done that it feels like a novice filmmaker was in charge. The budget seems to have been squandered on the wrong aspects, making the overall production quality subpar."
What was the most confusing aspect of the movie for you?,it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end. why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes! most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best. also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it. if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since. the ending sucked but the rest was great,"The movie had a disjointed plot with a nonsensical ending that left viewers scratching their heads. The film started off with cheap scares and rushed through character deaths, failing to build any real suspense. While some actors delivered decent performances, the confusing storyline dampened any potential enjoyment. The gratuitous gore and attempts at humor fell flat, leaving a disappointing overall impression."
What were viewers disappointed about in the film?,"this film has its good points: hot chicks people die<br /><br />the problem... the hot Chicks barley get nude and you don't get to see many of the people dieing, mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes.<br /><br />also for those of you watching this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a side chearator with a very small role and Minor nude scenes.<br /><br />What this film needed.. script and story would be nice but I will not complain about that.. simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks...<br /><br />I wouldn't waste my money on it...and if you must, wait until it's on the OLD shelves at your local video store","Viewers were disappointed that there was not enough nudity, limited showcasing of death scenes, and minimal involvement of the main attraction, Jenna Jameson. The film was critiqued for lacking a compelling script and story, ultimately leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and advising against spending money on it."
"What are some of the major criticisms about the TV show ""Amazing Stories""?  
Negative","Most of the episodes on Season 1 are awful..There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they programs actually had decent story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are well dull..not amazing in the least..go rent or buy the Twilight Zone series...I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the DVD's they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further diminishes this compilation. The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985...Most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering...","Most of the episodes in Season 1 were quite dull and lackluster, failing to compete with classics like Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. The storylines were uninspiring and predictable, leaving viewers unimpressed. The decision to cut out parts featuring actor Ray Walston further detracted from the overall compilation. The potential for intriguing twists and turns was missed, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience overall."
What makes this movie a complete disappointment for you?,"I am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5.2/10 For what affects me, it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I still keep wondering why I watched it until the end. First of all, the plot is totally hopeless, and the acting truly awful. I think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci; concerning Mr. Kamar Del's Reyes, I think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his ""Valley of the Dolls"". To sum up, it is total waste of time(and i'm trying to stay polite...) to avoid at any cost. My rating is 1 and I still think it is well paid, but since we cannot give a O....","I absolutely can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot is a mess, the acting is unbearable, and the casting choices were terrible. Susan Lucci's performance was cringeworthy, and Kamar Del Reyes should have stayed far away from this project. I regret watching it till the end and would strongly advise avoiding it at all costs. A rating of 1 feels generous for this disaster of a movie."
Do you think the film lacks a central event that ties the characters together well?,"This kind of film has become old hat by now, hasn't it? The whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop.<br /><br />It sure sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble cast, some good gags, and some human drama about what could have/might have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that binds them all together, like there was in ""The Big Chill"", one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one. You end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone. The superficiality this creates is not just annoying, it's maddening. The below-average script doesn't help.","This kind of film has become old hat by now, hasn't it? It's filled with syrupy nostalgia and lacks a central event to bind the ensemble cast together. The superficiality created by short takes on each character is maddening and the below-average script doesn't help elevate the film."
"Was ""Indian Summer"" able to capture the audience's attention effectively?","Like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies, ""Indian Summer"" is a sleep inducing bore. Eight alumni campers are barely introduced, when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about. Fine actors, Alan Arkin, and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this film. One camper's observation that ""everything seems so much smaller than I remember it"" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm. The anticipated pranks are neither funny or original, unless you think that short sheeting is a real ""howler"". This movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved. ""Indian Summer"" did not make me homesick, just sick. - MERK","Unfortunately, ""Indian Summer"" failed to engage the audience due to its slow pace, lackluster character development, and repetitive dialogue. Despite having talented actors like Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton, their performances were overshadowed by the uninteresting and unimaginative storyline. The movie was a major letdown, leaving viewers feeling unimpressed and unattached to the campers' journey."
Was the movie able to provide any entertainment value or engage the audience in any way?,"Wonderful cast wasted on worthless script. Ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles. Could this ever happen in a million years? It's simply a fantasy, and a boring one at that. Do they become teenagers again? Do they reenact their pranks, games, good times? They may try but ultimately the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any suspense? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.","The movie falls flat due to a lackluster and unbelievable storyline, leaving a talented cast with little to work with. It fails to capture any intrigue, suspense, horror, or comedy, resulting in a disappointing and forgettable viewing experience."
"What are some flaws in the film ""Rise of Evil""?",I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts. Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities. Anyone who watched this film now probably think of Hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some Chicago gangster. I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average. I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler.,"I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with real historical facts. The actors' performances are very poor due to limited acting possibilities. The portrayal of Hitler as a crazy skinny lunatic running with a gun like a Chicago gangster is not realistic and detracts from the credibility of the film. Overall, ""Rise of Evil"" falls far below average and there are much better films about Hitler and Germany during that time period. I would recommend watching the German film ""Downfall"" instead for a more accurate and compelling portrayal of Adolf Hitler."
"What did you think of the movie? 

Negative","I'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake.<br /><br />After seeing Der Untergang this is a huge disappointment. There's no connection between different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor I couldn't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential.<br /><br />And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound to it, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he's speaking/yelling German.<br /><br />The way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened.<br /><br />Whether it's the English or the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.","Just based on the language and acting alone, it's hard to ignore how cheap and fake everything felt in this film. The lack of connection between scenes and poor acting made it a huge disappointment, especially when compared to a much better film like Der Untergang. It's a big mistake to have everyone in Germany speaking English, as it takes away from the authenticity and vibe of the movie. Additionally, the storytelling seemed improvised and the characters felt hollow, making the whole film seem like a messy collection of random events. It just lacked the substance and depth needed to be engaging."
What are some major historical inaccuracies in the movie?,"This 1919 to 1933 Germany looks hardly like a post WWII Czech capitol. Oh sorry, it is the Czech capitol and it is 2003, how funny.<br /><br />This is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past. Röhm is a head higher than Adolf and looks so damned good, Göring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the ""Führer"" always seems to look like 56. And the buildings, folks, even buildings have been young, sometimes. Especially 1919 were a lot of houses in Germany nearly new (the WWI does not reach German cities!). No crumbling plaster! Then the Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons around this building, never. And this may sound to you all like a miracle: in the year 1933 the Greater Berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines, some even with turntable ladders, but none with a hand pump.<br /><br />One last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this at the final sequence? For me this was a kind of ""Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland""","The movie is riddled with glaring historical inaccuracies that completely detract from the viewing experience. From the absurd physical appearances of key historical figures like Röhm and Göring to the unrealistic depiction of buildings and technology, the film fails to capture the essence of the time period it is set in. The final sequence featuring a Playmobil castle further diminishes the credibility of the movie, turning a serious historical event into what feels like a caricature."
Did the movie accurately portray the Texan lifestyle?,"Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.","The movie is nauseating with a weak plot that reinforces stereotypical images of Texans as beer-drinking, honky-tonkin' rednecks. The fake Texas accents are overdone, making it hard to take the movie seriously. John Travolta and Debra Winger's performances were unconvincing, especially in terms of authenticity to the Texan culture."
What aspects of this movie were disappointing to the viewers?,"The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here. Two of those things were singing and dancing. Another was a short, interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off The Depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's successful films.<br /><br />This film achieved none of the above, despite the star presences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring, and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you didn't get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants. I guess they learned after this movie.","The movie failed to captivate audiences despite the star-studded cast of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard. The plot was lackluster with too much unnecessary dialogue, leading to boredom. The absence of a feel-good ending left viewers dissatisfied, proving that this film fell short of what the public expects from a good movie."
What are some of the major flaws in this movie according to the review?,"The movie is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure's spirit. The quite horribly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality.<br /><br />The movie continues throughout to ""Hollywood-ise"" the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. The movie manages to be predictable throughout, even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences.<br /><br />All in all, a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain.","The movie fails to capture the original adventure's spirit, miscasts the lead actor, dulls down the plot to fit Hollywood standards, features bad acting, and disappointing fight scenes. Ultimately, it is a terrible addition to movies based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain."
"What did the producers, directors, and writers fail to understand about the original story in the movie adaptation of King Solomon's Mines?","OK. Not bad movie making if it were from an original script. BUT IT IS NOT!<br /><br />Which part of ""in this story there are no women, except for Foulata and Gagoola"" introduction by Haggard did the producers, directors and writers not understand? I mean, it is pretty plain English. I understood it at age 10!. The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, the colonial Africa, the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with. But, nooo, they have to throw ""romance"" into it. Pathetic. Suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book. Give it up. Until a Peter Jackson wannabe comes along and ""does it right"" you may as well keep re-reading the tome. BTW, there is a sequel book (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. It gives background to the story of Quatermain. It is a bit creepy but good.",The movie adaptation of King Solomon's Mines disappointingly deviates from the original story by unnecessarily introducing romance and failing to stay true to the source material which beautifully depicted three different worlds. Fans of the book may need to stick to the tome until a better adaptation comes along.
Does the movie stay true to the original novel's storyline and character development?,"The movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the Novel. If you want to see the movie then don't read the novel first as it will shock you. However, cinematography was OK and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores Africa then go for it. Acting performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.","The movie fell short of capturing the essence of the novel, deviating from the original storyline and character traits. Fans of the book may find themselves disappointed by the changes made to the plot and the characters. It lacks the depth and intricacies that were present in the novel, leaving out crucial events that added to the richness of the story. The alterations made to characters like Gagool and Sir Henry Curtis may leave viewers feeling disconnected from the film adaptation."
Were the special effects as amazing as described on the cover?,"I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"". Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn i have had before though. This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed. It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I don't. Keep away from this one. If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere.","The special effects were non-existent, and the movie turned out to be a huge disappointment. It lacked depth, the characters were poorly portrayed, and the overall message of solving problems with violence was concerning, especially for a family-oriented film. I would recommend avoiding this movie if you're looking for quality entertainment."
Can the casting choices in the movie hinder the viewer's enjoyment of the film?,"Swayze doesn't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 ""Scaramouche"", the 1952 ""Prisoner of Zenda"" and the 1950 ""King Solomon's Mines""; Patrick Swayze fails utterly. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was very good in an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version.","The casting of Patrick Swayze as Alan Quatermain and Alison Doody as the leading lady fails to live up to the performances of iconic actors like Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. Additionally, the portrayal of other key characters like Umbopa also falls short, making it difficult for viewers to connect with the film."
What elements of the movie failed to captivate the viewer and left them disappointed?,"I missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference. I found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for instance) in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script. ""Kind Solomon's Mines""...the very short part of the movie inside the ""mines"" was about as exciting as watching paint dry and I doubt that even a pre-school kid would've been spell-bound by watching the fight of the ""warriors"". The entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced American TV series. Give me Indiana Jones any day!","The film was described as extremely boring with disappointing acting, weak script, and lackluster action scenes. The setting inside the mines was unexciting, and the overall quality was likened to a cheap American TV series."
What aspects of the movie might lead to unintentional humor for viewers?,"Oh dear. Some of the best talent in British TV made this serial, and so I can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure, and had to settle for first takes of many scenes.<br /><br />There ARE some frightening scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that I found most of the story unintentionally funny ! Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ...<br /><br />For many years fans of British cult TV shows campaigned to have this serial released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. Now I think I understand why !","Some of the best talent in British TV was involved in this serial, but it seems like they were rushed, resulting in scenes that come off as silly rather than scary. The storyline, including moments like the hero nonchalantly discovering a dismembered corpse, can unintentionally elicit laughter from the audience. This may explain why the BBC hesitated to release this serial for many years."
What elements of the film make it stand out as a pioneering work that anticipated future filmmaking trends?,"Although this film was made before Dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking, and before digital triumphed over -- strike that. You get the point. This 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments. Corin Nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator. The pace is slow, but elegantly so, because the cinematography is so beautiful. Record it the next time its on T.V., because I guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip-off made-for- T.V. movie. Direct-to-video never felt so good!","The film's slow pace may not be everyone's cup of tea, and the story tends to drag on at times. Despite Corin Nemec's strong performance, some may find the overall execution lacking in excitement and engagement. The cinematography, while visually pleasing, may not be enough to make up for the film's shortcomings in pacing and storytelling."
"What are some key disappointments in the movie ""Game of Death 2"" that the reviewer highlighted?","The movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half. But later something happens and all the sudden Shannon turns into this straight faced, second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it's own context. The second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichés, bad acting, a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang.<br /><br />""Game of Death 2"" was bad and clownified Bruce, but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played Bruce Lee back then. I truly believe that she can do much better than this and I hope she participates in a better production next time.<br /><br />If you are a real hard core action fan and don't care about quality go ahead and see this movie. I was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed.","The movie starts off well with a promising lead character played by Shannon Lee and likeable side characters, but later on, Shannon's character takes a nosedive, becoming unconvincing and clichéd. The second half flounders with lack of charisma, bad acting, a weak plot, and poorly executed stunts. The actors chosen for the chechen mafia gang are particularly awful, detracting from the overall viewing experience. The film fails to live up to expectations and ends up being a major letdown for fans of the action genre."
Why did the filmmakers choose to deviate so drastically from the original Lensman series of novels in this movie adaptation?,"The original Lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre. It's pure adventure SF with some substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood hasn't filmed it verbatim because it's just the kind of thing they love: massive explosions, super-weapons, uber-heroics, hero gets the girl, aliens (great CGI potential), good versus evil in the purest form, etc etc. Instead (and bear in mind I'm a Japan-o-phile and anime lover) we get this horrendous kiddies movie that rips the guts out of the story, mixes in Star-Wars (ironic as the latter ripped off the books occasionally) pastiches and dumbs the whole thing down to 'Thundercats' level. To see Kimball Kinnison, the epitome of the Galactic Patrol officer and second stage Lensman portrayed as a small boy is pitiful (etc). I just can't understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made far more money (FAR!) by telling straight. It makes no sense.","The adaptation of the classic Lensman series into a movie was a major disappointment. Rather than staying true to the beloved source material's epic scale and sophisticated storytelling, the filmmakers opted for a simplified, childish version filled with cliches and borrowed elements from other popular franchises like Star Wars. The transformation of the powerful protagonist into a mere child was a poor creative decision that failed to capture the essence of the Galactic Patrol officer. By not fully utilizing the rich source material, the filmmakers missed an opportunity to create a more lucrative and faithful adaptation for both fans and general audiences."
Can you tell me about a film that made you feel uncomfortable and creeped out?,"This is a horrible little film--and unfortunately, the company that made this short made several others. The short is essentially a one-joke idea that wasn't funny to begin with and may also offend you. It certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children (most appeared about 2 years-old) cavorting about and pretending to be adults--in this case, a dancehall girl and bar room patrons. It's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults, but I can't see anyone WANTING to see this--especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp!! And then, other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations. At the time, I am sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles, but when looking at it today, that is what immediately comes to mind! Because of this, this boring film ALSO creeped me out and I hope to never see it again!! Pretty strange and pretty awful.","This film was a horrible little experience with very young children pretending to be adults in adult situations. The humor was not funny, and it could potentially offend viewers. The concept was a one-joke idea that fell flat, making it hard to watch as the children acted inappropriately for their age. The scenes with young children in adult roles were unsettling and even crossed the line of appropriateness, leaving a feeling of discomfort and creepiness. Overall, this film missed the mark and failed to entertain in any way."
What is the heartwarming story about red-haired brothers finding a seal during their beach vacation?,"While on a vacation at the beach, red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (as Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The lads christen their critter ""Sammy"", and spend summertime frolicking with the sandy sea lion. When it's time to go home, the boys begin to suffer separation anxiety. Young Mr. McGreevey decides they can't take ""Sammy"" back to ""Disneyland"" er, ""Gatesville"" - but, young Mr. Mumy packs him anyway. At home, they try to hide ""the Way-out Seal"" from adults, and, of course hijacks ensue! <br /><br />**** Sammy - The Way-out Seal, pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp",This film boasts a heartwarming story about two red-haired brothers who bond with a seal during their summer vacation. The charming interactions between the boys and the seal make for a delightful watch that will leave you feeling nostalgic for carefree childhood adventures. The film's humor and hijinks will keep audiences of all ages entertained from start to finish.
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find disappointing and why?,"Strange... I like all this movie crew and dark humor movies; but didn't like this one at all! It's awful, horrible and surely not funny at all. Pity cannot do a whole movie plot, disgust either. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fills the movie; it could have been removed. It should have been in another shorter format, surely. Maybe i expected too much from the crew - like saving the movie lol -. It's also filled with overused clichés of characters and situations... I don't get it why people liked it... ""Poetry"", ""hope""; nope 'mam, didn't see anything like that! ^^ All in all, it's empty and crude, pitiful and hopeless. Oh darn this one........","The reviewer expressed disappointment in the movie, labeling it as awful, horrible, and not funny. They criticized the long, empty moments in the film and suggested that it should have been shorter. Additionally, the reviewer found the characters and situations to be filled with overused clichés. They concluded by stating that the movie felt empty, crude, pitiful, and hopeless."
"What elements differentiate this movie from ""Lost in Translation""?","After I watched this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compared it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I immediately could see the reviewers point.<br /><br />This movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the format of the movie is nearly identical, but the PACING is incredibly different. ""10 Items"" rushes the viewer through the 1-day time line of the movie, whereas the better-planned ""Lost In..."" seems to stretch out over a few long days.<br /><br />I'm sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed. It seems his better roles now-a-days are supporting roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in sub-$10mil limited release movies and indie films.","The movie ""10 Items"" was criticized for attempting a similar theme as ""Lost in Translation"" but failing to match its pacing and depth. Many viewers found the rushed timeline of the movie to be a major drawback, especially when compared to the more well-planned and slower-paced approach of ""Lost in Translation"". Additionally, some viewers expressed disappointment in Morgan Freeman's leading role in this film, suggesting that his performance may have been more suited for supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than in smaller indie films."
What elements of the movie failed to meet the viewer's expectations?,This is no doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This makes your run of the mill TV movie look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by the one and only Britney Spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you got paid well) to save it. The story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal Ms Spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way. There is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day. Never ever again.,"This movie is a disaster from start to finish. It's like watching a failed attempt at a cheesy TV movie. The source material by Britney Spears and her mother did it no favors, resulting in a story that feels like a desperate attempt to promote Spears' music rather than tell a compelling story. The predictable plot makes it hard to stay engaged, with the only saving grace being a decent performance from Virginia Madsen. Overall, a complete waste of time."
What makes this movie so awful?,"hello boys and girls... this isn't your regular movie review, because this is going to be the cold. hard. truth. are you serious? this movie sucked so many balls i couldn't keep them out of my mouth! they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen. you'd need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie.<br /><br />the plot was very lacking. the actors were terrible. i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit. do boys, everyone!<br /><br />peace R&H besties4lyf","Let me tell you folks, this movie is a train wreck from start to finish. The plot is as thin as a piece of tissue paper, the acting is so bad that even a high school play would put these actors to shame. The dance number? Don't get me started, I had to keep rewinding it not because it was good, but because I couldn't believe how cringeworthy it was. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this disaster of a film at all costs."
What specific aspects of the movie made it so unenjoyable for you?,"This is possibly the most boring movie in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor/director Roman Polanski. I think I would rather see the Three Amigos than ever watch this movie again. It promptly went from the DVD player straight into the garbage. My apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked New Coke as well. I am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie, it is slow, dull and has no real plot. You wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started. I understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around. Thank god disco and Three's Company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the Bay City Rollers. Oh well just my thoughts.","This movie was a complete snooze fest. It felt like a never-ending drag with no real excitement or plot to keep you engaged. From the very start, it failed to captivate and left me feeling utterly disappointed. The slow pace and lack of direction made me wish I had never hit play. It's hard to comprehend how anyone could find enjoyment in such a dull and uninspiring film. Save yourself the boredom and steer clear of this one."
"Based on the negative review, can you tell me what aspects of the movie were particularly criticized?","I'll be blunt and to the point. This film is not good at all. The film buff part of me hated the acting, script, story, direction and almost all of the editing. Amanda Peet has proven that she can act, as she was a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'. So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole. However, the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny. If you can forget about how underpar the production quality is, and if you find smut jokes funny, then you should be all right. And for those of you who can't get off your pedestal, thats your choice. My inner child hasen't died, and I laughed a fair bit. Even then, only a 3 out of ten, because as a movie, it really does stink.","The film was heavily criticized for its acting, script, story, direction, and editing. The only saving grace mentioned was the humor for those who enjoyed smut jokes."
What makes this movie fall short in terms of character likability and humor?,"A poorly written script with no likeable characters. As for it being a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about 2 conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them (no sex scenes) and another friend(who is semi-discustingly weird)who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates. The 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without really any romance. The 3 guys stop being friends as they separately dated her. She scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women. -- A bad movie","The movie relies on a poorly written script with unlikable characters and fails to deliver any laughs despite being labeled as a comedy. The plot revolves around two conceited friends who scam their way into getting women into bed, with another friend who is portrayed as disgustingly weird and known mainly for his masturbation habits. The trio separately falls for the same woman, creating a storyline lacking any real romance. Ultimately, the film fails to engage the audience and ends up being a bad movie overall."
"Do you think ""Whipped"" successfully portrays the dynamics between men and women in dating relationships?","Four best friends young male chauvinist pigs (with the emphasis on pigs) meet weekly at a NYC diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable ""whipping"". Although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had, overall the flick doesn't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story. One of those one-man band flix with a dozen producers, ""Whipped"" is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think ""The Man Show"" is Emmy material.","The film's portrayal of the interactions between the male characters and the women they date falls flat, perpetuating outdated stereotypes and fails to offer any meaningful insight into modern relationships. The attempts at humor often come across as offensive and the overall message of the movie is muddled and unsatisfying."
What makes this movie so unbearable to watch?,"Personally, while I'm able to appreciate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap. You know, those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie-cutter action movie to kill time. This is the only movie that I can remember actually shutting off in the middle, and I have absolutely NO intention of going back to finish it. The plot was so contrived and predictable, I was calling out what the next scene would be easily (and I'm usually not very good at this). The actors were horrible, I've seen better acting in middle school plays. Even the scene cuts were bad, the flow was all wrong.<br /><br />This movie is like a parody that forgot the funny.","The movie had a painfully predictable plot, terrible acting, and poorly executed scene cuts. It felt like a parody without the humor, making it a forgettable and unenjoyable viewing experience."
What was it about the characters in the movie that made the reviewer feel uneasy?,"I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but this was too much. The acting wasn't great, but that wasn't the real problem. The issue was the sinking feeling I got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.","The movie's characters lacked depth and were portrayed as hollow and cruel, making them feel like cardboard cutouts with no real personalities."
Can you give us a quick overview of the movie and share about your experience watching it?,"Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero, but this does easily. The movie is about 3 single guys who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. A fourth guy - who is married and - that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid at all costs.","Oh man, this movie was a complete disaster. The plot was weak, the jokes fell flat, and the characters were extremely one-dimensional. I found myself cringing more than laughing at the attempts at humor. The whole concept felt tired and overdone, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time watching it. Avoid this one like the plague."
"What makes ""Whipped"" one of the worst films of all time?","""Whipped"" is one of the most awful films of all time. It is a mean, hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000, besides maybe ""The Grinch."" It is not, as people have called it, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. That would be a little film called ""High Fidelity."" Whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic, ""Whipped"" is hostile, cynical, misanthropic cinematic poison. Avoid this like so many plagues, unless you want to see how truly bad a ""comedy"" can get.","""Whipped"" is a mean-spirited and hateful movie that lacks the insight and honesty of other films portraying modern relationships. It comes across as hostile, cynical, and overall a cinematic poison that should be avoided at all costs."
What are the main flaws of the movie according to the review?,"For months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media, so I patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you cannot stand any of them. The film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric, moronic, and crude. The only slightly amusing character is Eric, whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on. The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet. All in all, only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor.","The movie is criticized for having unlikable characters with shallow development, relying on dialogue that is deemed immature and vulgar, with only one slightly entertaining character. The final twist in the plot failed to redeem the characters, leaving the viewer feeling resentful rather than amused."
What makes this movie so lacking in entertainment and originality?,"This film is not funny. It is not entertaining. It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation. Added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like. This movie is boring, obnoxiously mind-numbing, and at times offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also, it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time.","This film disappoints with its lack of humor and originality, failing to engage viewers with uninteresting characters and situations. It comes across as juvenile and poorly thought out, like the product of inexperienced teenagers' misconceptions about adulthood. Additionally, the movie is tedious, annoying, and occasionally offensive, with only occasional moments of humor to redeem it. It feels unnecessarily long despite its relatively short runtime."
"What are some aspects of ""Whipped"" that make it fall short for viewers?","""Whipped"" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. Three unlikable New York Lotharios, ruthless ""scammers,"" end up wooing the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. That applies to the story and the film. Too sophomoric to be misogynistic, flaccid and ridiculous, ""Whipped"" mixes the philosophies of shock jock Tom Lykis with Penthouse letter fantasies. Though technically proficient it's dated, grating, poorly written, mean, and obvious. People don't act like this. People don't talk like this. Really.","""Whipped"" suffers from a lack of likable characters, a sophomoric and dated storyline, and writing that comes across as mean and obvious. The film tries to mix shock jock philosophies with unrealistic fantasies, resulting in a flaccid and ridiculous narrative that fails to resonate with audiences. The portrayal of characters as ruthless ""scammers"" and the interactions between them feel forced and unrealistic, making it hard for viewers to connect or empathize with the story."
What makes the movie fail to resonate with some viewers?,"BEGIN SPOILER: Fitfully funny and memorable for Mr. Chong's literal roach-smoking scene: Chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe's bowl, lights up, coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity,then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat, re-loads the bowl properly, re-lights, re-tokes. END SPOILER. Alas, I began to lose faith less than half-way through the proceedings. It occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable. I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer brighter company. Yet, the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble-minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they-- the former are sober. Notable guest appearance by Paul Reubens spouting obscenities in pre-Pee-wee form.","Some viewers may find the lackadaisical duo obnoxious and less relatable compared to more contemporary stoner characters like Harold and Kumar. The humor may cater more towards baked frat bros or those who are easily amused by stoner jokes, rather than appealing to a wider audience."
What are the key aspects that make this movie an unappealing action adventure film?,"One of those el cheapo action adventures of the early 1980s that used to fill video rental stores solely to be taken out by adolescent boys in the hope of a cheap thrill.<br /><br />Woeful down market attempt to cash in on the Death Wish phenomenon by substituting a moderately attractive woman for the visually challenging Bronson. Acting is terrible, sets are cheap, the baddies are, well, bad. Identification with any of the characters is unlikely.<br /><br />Only redeeming feature is modest amount of gratuitous female nudity, a smattering of which is full frontal. Other than that, you can leave it...","This movie falls flat with its atrocious acting, cheap production sets, and unlikeable characters. It capitalizes on the Death Wish trend but fails to deliver, replacing a compelling lead with a mediocre woman. It's unlikely for viewers to connect with any character and the only noteworthy aspect is the crude inclusion of female nudity, which does nothing to elevate the poor quality of the film."
What are some shortcomings of the movie in terms of script and character portrayal?,"An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), as a hottie Charles Bronson going around wiping up the 'scum' that mugged her parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young hunks with her karate skills. In a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws HER in jail, so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison-dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah. I guess there were a lot of movies like this? The script is dumber than usual if you can believe that. Mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co-produce her own Death Wish starring role, and I find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ungainly apparatus. Competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here, and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing-incompetent DA and a judge that has got to be the producer's uncle.","The movie comes across as a vanity project for an unknown actress, with a plot that feels cliché and predictable. The script is poorly written and the characters, especially the antagonists, are portrayed as one-dimensional and unconvincing. The attempt at portraying the lead character as a vigilante seeking justice falls flat, making the film overall lack depth and substance."
"What are some notable flaws in the movie ""The Pride of the Clan""?","Mary Pickford becomes the chieftain of a Scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has a romance. As fellow commenter Snow Leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin. Some of it is amusing, such as Pickford whipping her clansmen to church, while some of it is just there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, contrived romance plot-line and its climax. The transfer is so dark it's difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even accounting for that, this doesn't appear to be director Maurice Tourneur's best work. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible 'The Poor Little Rich Girl,' typecasting Pickford as a child character.","While the film has some entertaining moments like Mary Pickford's portrayal of a clan chieftain, overall the story feels lacking, particularly with the weak romance plot that feels forced and recycled. The film's dark transfer makes it challenging to appreciate the scenery, and it seems this might not be director Maurice Tourneur's strongest work."
Were there any redeeming qualities about the film that made it worth watching to the end?,"This film turned up on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought that I'd warn even those who enjoy watching B grade bad movies (which I do)that this is not even amusing. The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film, obviously shot in the early seventies, consists of extreme wide shots of people walking, in real time and awfully slowly, from A to B. This makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens. I am really curious - how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end?","The film failed to deliver on any entertainment value due to its slow pacing and lack of a satisfying payoff. Most of the shots were boring, with little happening to engage the audience. It left viewers wondering if there was any point to the film at all."
What are your thoughts on the overall quality of the movie?,I saw this movie a couple years back. I could'nt sleep and there was nothing on. So I peeped it. What really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing. Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts making out with Richard's girl while she's unconscious. Then Jarvis's buddy Troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar. By the next morning it shows Richard's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then she walks back to Richard and looks at him while he's still tied up. Then they play some happy music and the movie is finished. I mean what happened? Did they brake up? And what was she saying to those 2 guys(Trouby and Jarvis)? Its to puzzling and to poor to. I can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense. This was the worst film i've ever seen since the 90's version of Lord of the Flies.,"I had a really hard time understanding this movie. It was so confusing and didn't make any sense at all. The bizarre scenes like Richard getting tied up and his girlfriend interacting with other guys while he's helpless were just too much for me. The ending left me with more questions than answers, and I was left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated by the lack of coherence in the storyline. Overall, this movie was a mess and one of the worst films I've seen in a long time."
What were viewers' overall impressions of the television series 'The Racing Game' based on the review provided?,"Basing a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'The Racing Game'. Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand, only to have it replaced by an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma ( and looked like one of the bad guys ) while Mick Ford ( who played the irritating Chico Barnes ) made me think of a horse's arse whenever he was on screen. For six weeks, this less-than dynamic duo charged about the countryside, foiling nefarious plots to fix races, usually by the same methods - blackmail, kidnapping riders or doping horses. Yorkshire Television threw money at the show, but to no avail. Violent, sexist, far-fetched and repetitious, it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard.","The television series 'The Racing Game' based on the popular author Dick Francis's works was met with disappointment and criticism by viewers. The actors, particularly Mike Gwilym as Sid Halley, lacked charisma and failed to engage the audience. Mick Ford's performance as Chico Barnes came across as irritating and unlikable. The plot of the show was deemed violent, sexist, far-fetched, and repetitive, with little variation in the storyline for each episode. Despite efforts to invest money into the production, the show ultimately failed to capture viewers' interest and was quickly deemed a failure."
What kind of impact does the glorification of a psychotic murderer in this film have on the audience?,"It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood.<br /><br />In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship.","The movie showcases a concerning trend in Hollywood where Communist totalitarianism is being supported and glorified despite the atrocities associated with it. Additionally, the glorification of a psychotic murderer without including the heinous crimes committed portrays a misguided admiration for such characters, raising ethical concerns about the filmmakers' intentions."
What aspect of the movie did the reviewer feel was poorly executed?,"i think that's this is awful produced and directed movie. Benicio Del Toro shouldn't work in production of movies, he should put accent on his acting and that's it. Steven Soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution, about it's ideals, and most important about life of Che Guevara and so on. Camera is awful, like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it, music is ...i don't know..is there some music in the movie???? i will not recommended this piece of sh.. to no one. It's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever.... I can't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars. DISASTER....DISASTER....DISASTER....DISASTER Don't watch please. Save yourself from this misery of ""movie""","The reviewer expressed strong dissatisfaction with the production quality, direction, acting, and overall interpretation of the movie's themes. They criticized Benicio Del Toro's involvement in the production, highlighting Steven Soderbergh's failure to capture the essence of the revolution and Che Guevara's life. The camera work and music were also labeled as subpar, leading the reviewer to adamantly advise against watching the movie due to its perceived lack of quality."
What are some of the major flaws in this movie?,"If it wasn't for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the clueless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />The plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion, which takes place in a supposed abandon high school(looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick), and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on. This student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge.<br /><br />John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much, as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady(Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed, but never see a blasted thing! This is a horrible movie that continued National Lampoon's downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s.","The plot is centered around a high school reunion where a deranged former student seeks revenge on his classmates. However, the setting looks cheap and unrealistic. The film fails to deliver on its promise of suspense and horror, with only minimal on-screen killings that lack any impact. The movie seems to have a misguided focus on certain characters and lacks genuine thrills, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience."
Can you tell me about a comedy film that you were disappointed by?,"Anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two stoners in the film. This film is NOT under-rated...it is a bad movie. <br /><br />There should be no comparisons between this film and The Naked Gun or Airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny. Class Reunion is neither of those things. The sad thing is it had such potential (good cast, good story lines) but the good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing. The stoner guys, the vampire, the blind girl...NOT FUNNY. The only funny character were Delores (the one who sold her soul to the devil).<br /><br />National Lampoon has made some really good films (Animal House, Vacation) but this isn't one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.","I recently watched a film called Class Reunion and I have to say, I was thoroughly unimpressed. The jokes fell flat, the characters were annoying, and the storyline lacked any real comedic value. Despite having a decent cast and potential for humor, the film failed to deliver on all counts. It's definitely not on par with classic comedies like The Naked Gun or Airplane. Overall, I found Class Reunion to be a major letdown and not worth the watch."
What are some reasons to avoid watching this movie?,"Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted. Lame jokes abound, and every punch line is well telegraphed. The dumb one liners come at a fast pace, and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and seek out one of ""Lampoon's"" truly funny films like ""National Lampoon's Golddiggers"" - MERK","Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks with a wasted cast, lame jokes, predictable punchlines, flat one-liners, boring musical numbers, and a claustrophobic setting in an abandoned high school."
"Was ""Class Reunion"" able to capture the same humor and success as ""Animal House""?","The biggest National Lampoon hit remains ""Animal House"", and rightly so. It was funny, raucous and good-natured.<br /><br />The exact opposite of every other National Lampoon film. Including ""Class Reunion"".<br /><br />PLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst (""Flounder"") from ""Animal House"". Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this jumbled mess. This reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful.<br /><br />One star, and that's being generous. Then again, I always thought most of my old classmates were demons, vampires and serial killers, too.","""Class Reunion"" falls flat in comparison to the success of ""Animal House"". Despite the presence of Stephen Furst and John Hughes's involvement, this film is described as a jumbled mess that lacks humor and entertainment value. The reviewer compares watching this film to enduring a painful root canal, ultimately giving it a generous one-star rating."
"What aspects of the movie ""National Lampoon's Class Reunion"" fell short according to the review provided?","NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. It didn't stay long in theaters in my big city. Why? Because it's BAD!!!!!<br /><br />Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way. The entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey.<br /><br />The idea is actually great (a parody of slasher flicks) but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect. <br /><br />Just avoid this ""comedy"". Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire.","The movie ""National Lampoon's Class Reunion"" was described as a painful and unfunny flop with unknown actors, lacking in execution and overall being an embarrassing misfire."
"What are some drawbacks of the movie ""Pokemon: Celebi - Voice of the Forest""?","Not one of the better pokemon movies.<br /><br />Two legendary pokemon come into the story. You do get to see how strong Celebi can be, though he turns evil first.<br /><br />Suicune also makes an appearance, he didn't seem that powerful.<br /><br />The Marauder didn't have many strong pokemon at all, except for that taranitar? Some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better.<br /><br />Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak, though they don't realise it. Misty I was thinking had it at the end but she didn't get close. I saw this in the credits.<br /><br />Don't expect much here, the worst of the series so far.","This movie did not meet the standards set by the previous Pokemon films. The storyline involving the two legendary Pokemon, Celebi and Suicune, fell short of showcasing their true power. The antagonist, the Marauder, lacked strong Pokemon, which resulted in unexciting fight scenes. The introduction of a much younger Professor Oak and the misty subplot didn't add much value to the movie. Overall, this movie can be considered the weakest in the Pokemon film series."
Why did the movie fail to live up to expectations?,"The movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was out of course and didn't have as an interest as the other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same corny humor and cliche bad guys. The movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The movie should better not associated with animes such as Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime. It is a shame even to talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon. Digimon is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to Pokemon.It's second movie is coming out late 2002.","The movie disappointed me with its weak plot, lack of originality, and unimpressive animation. Fans of Pokemon are likely to feel let down by this uninspired film that lacks the charm and excitement of the original anime."
What made this movie disappointing for the reviewer?,"Wow. This movie bored the pants off me when I saw it. Bland, pointless and unmoving.<br /><br />Apparently, Ash and co. can travel through time with the help of ""The Spirit of the Forest"" ('Princess Mononoke' much??) There, they meet a dorky kid named Sam, and the ""plot"" begins.<br /><br />So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get high with nature, become hippies and try to free Celebi (the ""Spirit"") from some weirdo hunter guy. I don't even know what else went on. It all went by in a blur. Ash's friends were hardly in it, and all the fight scenes were boring.<br /><br />After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends, must return to their time, while watching Sam float away with Celebi (that scene was just creepy. O-O;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandpa. And I think that's it. Pretty retarded isn't it? If you love your children, you won't expose them to this. (1 out of 10.)","The movie was described as boring, bland, and pointless with uninteresting characters and a confusing plot that was reminiscent of another popular film. The action scenes were dull, the presence of Ash's friends was minimal, and the overall experience was forgettable and felt rushed. Additionally, a particular scene involving one of the characters floating away was labeled as creepy. The reviewer concluded by advising against exposing children to this movie."
What was the most disappointing aspect of the movie according to the review?,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane in. I understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers, who did pretty good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not believable.<br /><br />With all of the gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened. Even the coin being a bug on Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug, was not realistic.<br /><br />Looks like this movie was slapped together fast. Poor job. Get a better writer.<br /><br />The count down to the end was not in sync with anything. It took longer to fight. And what a coincidence that each time Billy was going to blast Sean, he'd be out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /><br />Actually, Billy's character was goofy. It was so stupid when Sean punches him out at the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!","The reviewer's main issue with the movie was the lack of believability in the plot and character actions. They found the storyline implausible, criticized the poor writing, and labeled Billy Zane's character as goofy and unrealistic. The reviewer also highlighted the excessive gunfire without police intervention, the implausible realization of the bug on Sean, and the unconvincing countdown to the end. They concluded by strongly criticizing the overall quality of the movie, deeming it as a poorly executed rush job that lacked coherence and depth."
What aspects of the movie failed to live up to the expectations set by the original book?,"I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After viewing the movie, I was TOTALLY disappointed. The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main object is to survive. But he's not in an arena. He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters. This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. The movie was absolute garbage. There was no cinematic quality to it. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed up with this one.","The movie adaptation of Stephen King's book completely missed the mark. Despite the high expectations set by the book, the movie failed to deliver on any level. The premise of the original story was completely altered, resulting in a lack of tension and suspense. The characters in the movie bore no resemblance to those in the book, leading to a disconnect for those who were familiar with the source material. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a respected actor, couldn't salvage this mess with his performance. Overall, the movie lacked any cinematic quality and was deemed as absolute garbage by disappointed audiences."
"Could the movie adaptation of ""The Running Man"" have been better received if it had not been set during the big action movie craze?",I read the running man from Kings books as Bachman and I felt for the main character John and his family. This movie could have been SO much more. The trouble? It was set during the big action movie craze. I watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing. I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause. Yes it had funny scenes (or laughable) though I think that it did not save the movie in my eyes. If you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of John as he gets his final revenge.<br /><br />I give this movie a low number. It may not have been this low if I had not read the book.,"The movie failed to evoke any emotional connection with the main character or his cause, making it a painful watch. Despite some attempts at humor, the overall execution fell short and failed to capture the essence and climax of the character's journey as portrayed in the original book."
What are some of the reasons this film received negative feedback from viewers?,"argh! this film hurts my head. and not in a good way.<br /><br />maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action genre, but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like Navy Seals, i still regarded this film with dislike. now i utterly despise it.<br /><br />take one fairly good fast-paced story. keep the title and throw the rest away. instead use some half-assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras? why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room?)<br /><br />the whole film screams eighties, from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes. ugh.<br /><br />don't watch this film. i know some people liked it, but some people get off on being peed on and i don't understand them either.","The film was criticized for its convoluted and nonsensical plot, filled with numerous inconsistencies and plot holes. Viewers found the futuristic gladiator storyline to be poorly executed and the overall visual style reminiscent of outdated 80s aesthetics, making it unappealing to modern audiences. Additionally, some viewers expressed strong dislike towards the film, comparing it to a despised relic of the action genre that failed to capture their interest or investment."
What aspects of the movie made it a waste of time for the reviewer?,"This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. It revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her, and then blackmails them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA, which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too! Meanwhile, the evil lesbian's girlfriend doesn't really like her sleeping around. It ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven. The women get naked a lot too, mostly in situations that stretch reality. bad bad bad.","The acting was subpar and unconvincing, the storyline was ridiculous focusing on an evil lesbian who manipulates and blackmails married men. The relationships portrayed were unrealistic and the excessive nudity felt forced and inappropriate. The film failed to engage the viewer and left a lot to be desired in terms of substance and credibility."
What themes does the movie focus on and how do they come across to the audience?,"this became a cult movie in chinese college students, though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel4, UK.<br /><br />full of arty giddy pretentions, the plot is mediocre and unreal; the 'spirit' it wants to convey is how independent artists 'resist the commercisliation of music industry' and maintain their' purity of an artistic soul' and wouldnt 'sell themselves for dirty money'. that is really giddy and superficial; the diologue are mainly pathetic. acting is poor. sceenplay is full of art pretention. it is a fantasy movie for kids and that;s all<br /><br />","Despite its popularity among Chinese college students, the movie falls short on substance. The plot feels mediocre and unrealistic, with a heavy-handed attempt to portray independent artists resisting commercialization in the music industry. The dialogue is cringeworthy, the acting is subpar, and the screenplay is filled with pretentious artistic elements. Ultimately, it can be seen as nothing more than a shallow fantasy movie aimed at a younger audience."
What elements of the film contribute to its high-octane action scenes and classy locations?,"this film has it all; the deft camera work, reminiscent of martin scorcese, or oliver stone, the tight acting of 'heat', the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie, the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say, 'the godfather'<br /><br />the judge reinhold character displays a fiery temperememt, yet also shows real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of robert de niro's portrayal of jake la motta in raging bull.<br /><br />the action scenes are truly breathtaking, not since bullit has a movie depicted such high octane, yet stylish car scenes. The special effects push the boundries of technology and filmmaking to their limits. Independance day set the standard that this movie clearly has matched, and greatly surpassed.<br /><br />overall, great acting from its a list cast (like an oscars night party invitation list!), classy locations, gripping action, and a tight script.","The film, unfortunately, falls victim to an overly ambitious attempt to blend elements of various iconic movies without truly finding its own voice. The result is a messy mishmash of styles and influences that come across as imitation rather than original. The characters lack depth and the storyline feels contrived, making it difficult for the audience to emotionally invest in the film. Additionally, while the action scenes may be visually impressive, they lack substance and rely heavily on flashy special effects to make up for a lack of genuine excitement. Overall, despite the star-studded cast, the film fails to live up to the standards set by the classics it tries so hard to emulate."
How did the film industry manage to release such a film?,"There is no story! The plot is hopeless! A filmed based on a car with a stuck accelerator, no brakes, and a stuck automatic transmission gear lever cannot be good! I would have stopped that car within one minute whether I was in it or in the police car constantly following it. I feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script. The few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily over-dramatized, and as far from reality you can get. In addition, there were a lot of blunders, for instance the hood of the runaway car, which was popped doing 100mph. At first it just folded over the windshield, like it would in reality, but then, afterwards, it blew off. The car was later in the movie observed with the hood on....<br /><br />This film was nothing but annoying, stay away from it!","The movie had a poor script and unrealistic action scenes, full of blunders that made it annoying to watch."
What are some major flaws in the movie?,"How this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me. The only actor who is at all known to me is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production.<br /><br />I don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award, this film really does make B movies a cinematic enjoyment. A car travelling along the freeway with police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yeah, right.<br /><br />The script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton. Most made for TV movies are awful but this redefines the word. Check out the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure Oscar material.","The movie is described as a piece of garbage with a lackluster script written on the back of a cigarette carton. The presence of accomplished actor Judge Reinhold does not redeem its poor quality. The storyline involving a car chase on a freeway with incompetent police adds to the ridiculousness of the film, making it unworthy of any praise. The overall acting performance is criticized, with even minor characters like the bridge operator being mocked for their lack of skill."
What did viewers think of the overall quality of the movie?,"Quite one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility. Apparently based on true events, though? If that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! Unfortunate then, that it was portrayed in such an inept manner.","Quite one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending, and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie."
What makes this movie one of the worst thriller movies ever seen?,"Weak plot, unlikely car malfunction, and helpless fumbling characters. At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was astonished. This is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />If you read this, be advised, if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting, like watching paint dry.","The movie features a weak plot, with an unlikely car malfunction and characters that fumble helplessly throughout. The overall quality feels outdated, reminiscent of a 70s TV show, making it a waste of time to watch when more exciting options are available, like watching paint dry."
What might disappoint knowledgeable Beatles fans about this movie?,"For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, mis-attribute quotes, incorrect clothing, out of place songs, and (shame shame) incorrect instruments and other boners I just cant think of right now. The flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.<br /><br />I didn't give this a ""1"" primarily due the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give it their all (the Lennon character is credible and does a good job). Also, the song ""Cry for a Shadow"" is heard at one point and THAT counts for SOMETHING.<br /><br />So,,, watch it for fun, but please don't take it as historically accurate.","The movie is filled with flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, and wildly exaggerated events, making it a poor choice for those seeking historical accuracy. The fast and numerous errors require a sharp eye to catch them all, tarnishing the overall viewing experience."
What are some major drawbacks of this movie?,"The movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story. Kill Kill, would have been nice. The movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and choppy. The movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured. Just a waste of movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but I have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense. If people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night, pick something else. If you have a soul don't damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth.","The movie disappoints with its misleading title and a weak story that fails to engage the audience. Despite attempting to shock viewers with taboo scenes, they come off as unnecessary and poorly executed. The choppy editing further adds to the lack of coherence in the storyline. It feels like a script written by an amateur, wasting valuable resources on props and budget. This film falls short in quality and substance, making it a regrettable choice for a movie night."
What are some major flaws in the movie that detract from its quality?,"I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad it was, although based on the catalog description I was excited to see it. Supposedly a ""mockumentary"" of two high school students making a documentary of high school life, it featured bad acting, bad directing, completely lack of engaging characters as written, and all-around is a total bust. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-consciously ""cool"" although they are supposed to be outcasts. You get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making an on-purposely-bad movie to show their friends, yet somehow it got into Sundance. Mystifying.","I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad it was, although based on the catalog description I was excited to see it.

What are the major shortcomings of the film?,"This film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly, just painfully mediocre. Lacking any real wit or imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the `jokes' (which are predictable and threadbare) are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer. Another notch to mark the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what `shocked' or amused us 30 years ago doesn't work quite the same way now. We've seen it all before, and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated. A major miss.","The film is painfully mediocre, lacking wit, imagination, and a thin plot stretched to the absolute limit. The jokes are predictable and threadbare, leading to boredom and yawns for the viewer. It represents a sad decline for John Waters, failing to shock or amuse as it relies on outdated tactics that no longer break any taboos."
What makes this movie so unenjoyable to watch?,"This may very well be the worst movie I'll see if I live to be 100. I think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this. I'm dumber for having watched it, and God have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film.<br /><br />And after I finally turned it off, I actually had the urge to vomit.<br /><br />No one had a clue about photography when made this. No one had a clue about acting. No one had a clue about just about anything.<br /><br />I can't believe F/X shows this crap on occasion. The only time I had seen it was on one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was on at about 3 a.m. at that.","This movie is an absolute disaster from start to finish. It's hard to believe that anyone involved had a basic understanding of filmmaking. The plot is so nonsensical that it seems like a child's school project gone wrong. The visual elements, like cinematography and special effects, are abysmal, making it painful to even look at the screen. The acting is atrocious, with performances that are cringe-worthy at best. It's no wonder that even the reviewer felt physically ill after watching this trainwreck. The fact that it was buried in a late-night time slot is a clear indicator of its lack of quality."
What are some criticisms of cultural representation in the movie?,"The movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichés which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight. The Middle Eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: there obviously are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women clad in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible. <br /><br />The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight, you should skip this movie.","The movie lacks real cross-cultural insight and relies heavily on clichés to depict the Middle Eastern leg of the journey, resulting in an unrealistic and irritating portrayal. The characters are poorly developed and the plot lacks credibility, ultimately failing to offer any meaningful cultural exploration."
"What are your thoughts on the movie ""China in Italy""?","I was China in this film. I choose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling at the time in Italy and they couldn't pronounce my real name correctly, so I choose Sheeba and then added Alahani since it was similar to Alohalani.<br /><br />I had never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to film. They gave me ""acting lessons"" each morning (which obviously were not useful). They dubbed my voice (thank goodness).<br /><br />David and Peter were a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax write off according to inside information. <br /><br />I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had ""acting"" in it.","Well, to be honest, the fact that one of the actors admitted to having no acting experience and needing their voice dubbed because their performance was lacking doesn't really bode well for the quality of the movie. It seems like the film was primarily made for fun rather than to deliver a compelling story or solid acting. Additionally, the revelation that the film was considered a tax write off does raise some questions about its overall production value and intentions."
Can this medieval epic truly captivate the audience despite its flaws?,"Cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating (except for the dragon prop). Now just how did the long-gone studio known for Chuck Norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? Case in point: the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution. They actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos, just to make this look even better. For the two ""Barbarian Brothers"", they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land. This is the single greatest waste of potential I've seen from an ""expensive"" low-budget movie, and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy. All of this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS! The movie alone makes a great souvenir!","The movie tries to impress with its stunning visuals, but it falls short due to amateurish acting, a horrible plot, and a laughable dragon prop. It's clear that the studio's lack of knowledge in executing a medieval legend leads to a disappointing outcome. The attempt to distract from its weaknesses with exploitation tactics involving hundreds of scantily clad women only further highlights the film's failure. The ""Barbarian Brothers"" lack convincing performances as they struggle to portray brave warriors, ultimately resulting in a wasted potential for an otherwise promising low-budget movie."
"What is the main appeal of the movie ""The Ladies Man""?","The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There's not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, but I've seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it.<br /><br />Rating: 6/10","The Ladies Man might offer some laughs, but overall it lacks depth and the supporting cast falls flat. It's entertaining if you're looking for something light-hearted, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression. The humor is hit or miss, and the storyline feels shallow. It's definitely not a memorable movie and doesn't offer much substance beyond a few amusing moments."
What are some major drawbacks of this film?,"Really bad shot on video ""film"" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video makers.<br /><br />If you're going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood, gore and nudity. There is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex. The lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking.<br /><br />There seems to be no editing effects- fades, wipes etc. Once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes.<br /><br />Terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits.The werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the ""actors"" face. They didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks, arms or wrists.<br /><br />I guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie.No reason at all to buy, rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video.","The movie is poorly made with amateur video makers, lacking essential elements like blood, gore, and nudity. The editing is subpar with minimal effects, and the werewolf representation is disappointing with rubber masks. The music and end credits are dominated by bad heavy metal bands. It is described as a prime example of how not to create a low-budget video, offering no compelling reason to watch it."
What are some of the drawbacks of the movie?,"What's with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? It's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens.<br /><br />The violence and nudity might turn some people off but, that, along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie I suppose.<br /><br />My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, ""Alas, your breed is dumb."" Okay, no one should ever say ""alas"" in a movie line unless they're English and living in the 18th century.<br /><br />The acting by the Van Helsing character and bad girl ""Rally"" isn't bad. I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little. Wicked martial arts! Don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it.","The video quality at times was very poor, almost as if the camera lens had mud on it. The violence and nudity may not sit well with all viewers and the acting, for the most part, was subpar. Additionally, some of the dialogue delivery felt out of place, like when Tarquin the Vampire said ""Alas, your breed is dumb."" It just didn't fit."
What are some drawbacks of the movie?,"This was a ""cute"" movie at first, then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs, at best.<br /><br />There is too much King James English spoken with is not only annoying in today's world but not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film? Forget it.<br /><br />Bing Crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as ""Hank Martin."" Rhonda Fleming (""Alisande La Carteloise"") was, too, in addition to her good looks and beautiful, long red hair. <br /><br />It's a nice movie with a feel-good ending, and I can't knock that. Maybe this is worthy of a rental, for historical sake or if you're a big Crosby fan but, overall, it's not that much.","The film started off cute, but then became overly sentimental and featured unimpressive songs. The use of old-fashioned language could be off-putting for modern audiences, especially young people. Despite some good performances by Bing Crosby and Rhonda Fleming, the overall movie may not be engaging for those not familiar with the era or big fans of Crosby."
How did the reviewers feel about the movie overall?,"Giving credit where it's due, only the technicolor, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it. <br /><br />Bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at Bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion.<br /><br />Just plain awful! Mark Twain's wit is not evident in any of the screenplay. Only die-hard Crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction. Even the extras look as though they don't know what they're supposed to be doing.<br /><br />Summing up: Dull as dishwater. Not recommended, even for children.","The movie was heavily criticized for its poor script, unconvincing performances, and lack of wit. The costumes and sets were the only redeeming qualities, but overall it was deemed as ""dull as dishwater"" and not recommended for anyone, not even children."
What are some major flaws in the movie?,"There are no spoilers here... Because there is no plot to spoil. Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required. The only bright spot are a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige, but then again, she IS Alice Krige. Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be. She is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot. How they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery. The screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script. It has major continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, horror formula writing, and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever. The creatures, while they have neat skills like going ""dim"", the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored. <br /><br />Don't waste any time on this one.","The movie lacks a coherent plot, with mediocre acting performances except for Alice Krige's delivery of a few good lines. The screenplay is poorly written, filled with continuity issues and superficial characters. The concept of the creatures is not explored enough, leaving the audience confused and unengaged. It's a movie that fails to make any sense and is not worth anyone's time."
What are some of the criticisms of this movie?,"Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.","While the idea of feline creatures feeding on young virgins may sound intriguing, the execution falls short with a lackluster storyline and unconvincing performances from some of the cast members. The addition of hints of incest adds unnecessary discomfort and the special effects failed to impress. Overall, this movie leaves much to be desired in terms of coherence and believability."
What was the most ridiculous aspect of the movie?,"this movie was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex, they also get scared of little kitty cats. they get set on fire by them. the mom cat alien thing kills a guy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn? they are bullet proof. invisible. and what not. the star of the movie, Clovis, is the cops cat, Clovis leads the cops to find the mom alien, and after the mom kills the cops, Clovis kills the mom by eating her head then she catches on fire. this movie sucks. it was way way more funny than it was scary, it wasn't even scaryt at all. the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera, it knoks him out. she then goes and hugs her. the then grabs her and begins to rape her. once again, Clovis comes to the rescue","The movie is just absurd, with a plot revolving around a mom and son cat having sex, getting scared of regular cats, and being set on fire by said cats. The mom alien kills a man with an ear of corn and the whole premise is so ridiculous that it's more funny than scary. The rape scene was completely unnecessary and added to the overall distastefulness of the film."
What are some major flaws in the movie Sleepwalkers?,"If you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere, kids, cause Sleepwalkers really sucks. Usually I'm more eloquent than that, but...wow...this was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen WALKING HOME. Where's his car?? Anyway, just don't see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jumping on people. A guy getting stabbed by corn. Cheesey lines up the proverbial ""wazoo"". Just don't see it. Wait, I take that back! See it for writer Stephen King's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard. He's actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But, other than that...wow...BAD.","Sleepwalkers is an utter disappointment for viewers longing for originality and engaging suspense. The film falls short with absurd plot holes, such as characters mysteriously losing their mode of transportation. The storyline is plagued with cheesy dialogue and nonsensical scenes, like cats randomly attacking people and a corn stabbing incident. Despite the star-studded cameos, including Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, Stephen King's cameo stands out as the only redeeming aspect. Overall, Sleepwalkers is a train wreck of a movie that should be avoided at all costs."
What did audiences dislike about the movie?<br />,"My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Certainly in the top ten of those I've watched all the way through. At least ""Plan 9"" was enjoyable.<br /><br />I DID really enjoy ""Christine"", ""The Dead Zone"", ""Firestarter"", ""Carrie"", and some of his other films. I didn't care much for ""Cujo"" (only because the sound was so bad on versions I've seen and I often couldn't tell what people were saying), or ""Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)"".<br /><br />But this mess was a total mistake in every way possible. The ""creatures"" themselves seemed designed by a 9-year-old. (No offense to 9-year-olds.)<br /><br />Even the ""one-liners"" made us groan and weren't remotely amusing.","Audiences felt that the movie was a total mistake in every way possible, with poorly-designed creatures and groan-inducing one-liners that were far from amusing."
What makes the film's production value fall short besides the helicopter shots?,"OK - the helicopter shots are fantastic, and the director made good use of some of Barcelona's top sights. Otherwise...production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the most depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was...well, William Baldwin. He got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running-jumping-earnest action figure. The rest of the cast was wooden at best, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a picture postcard with an action twist, and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.","The production value of this film quickly nosedives after the impressive helicopter shots, leaving the rest of the movie feeling like a generic TV movie. Most of the cast delivers wooden performances, with only a couple of actors managing to add depth to their characters. Save for Ellen Pompeo's charm and Abel Folk's effectiveness, the performances are lackluster at best. William Baldwin's portrayal is forgettable, relying too heavily on his martial arts background to compensate for a lack of substance in his character. Unless you have a strong sentimental attachment to Spain, this film is likely to disappoint with its lackluster delivery and lack of engaging characters."
Who is the weakest link in the film in terms of acting talent?,"Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments. I find that the plot and idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen a less talented ""actor"" How this person has ever been in a film or on television, I cannot imagine. In my opinion she would be better as a greater at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, does beg the question...... ""Who does she know""? I would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent. I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it.","While the plot and supporting actors were praised, the film was significantly dragged down by Ellen Pompeo's performance. The viewer expressed disbelief at Pompeo's suitability for her role and even suggested she would be better suited for a job at Wal-Mart. This negative review underscores the overarching sentiment that Pompeo's lack of talent severely impacted the overall quality of the movie."
Is this movie worth watching?,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. Trite. Predictable. Flat.<br /><br />The only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting Barcelona. I imagine they would use films like this in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA/NSA prison to torture suspects.<br /><br />Often bad movies have some redeeming features, this has nothing. If I was in it or worked on it, I would change my name. Truly a turd. Hard to write more than this, but I feel the world's film watchers needed a head's up on this. On the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can't stand.<br /><br />You could send it to politicians you dislike, in laws, ex-wives, Teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and a host of others.","This is one of the worst movies ever made. Trite. Predictable. Flat. The only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting Barcelona. Often bad movies have some redeeming features, this has nothing. Truly a turd."
"What about the movie ""Art Heist"" makes it unoriginal and lacking in direction?","This film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be forewarned that ""Art Heist"" doesn't add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no clue what to do with the film.<br /><br />William Baldwin keeps reappearing in films, and frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks, complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies. The only good movie in which he has appeared, is ""The Squid and the Whale"", in which he only speaks two, or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, doesn't fare much better; there is no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin.<br /><br />A movie to be seen at the viewer's own risk.","""Art Heist"" fails to bring anything new to the table, feeling like a copy of other films in the same genre. Director Bryan Goeres seems lost with the storyline, resulting in a lack of cohesive direction. The casting of William Baldwin and Ellen Pompeo does not do much to elevate the film, with their performances falling flat and lacking any chemistry. Overall, ""Art Heist"" is a movie that viewers should approach with caution."
What are some common issues in the movie that make it disappointing for viewers?,"This movie makes several mistakes. a few American actors in Spain , and the Spanish actors speaking English. the 'spaniards' English is OK, but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying. the dialog through the whole script is very weak; it may have been a Spanish script but translated incorrectly, who knows and who cares. i can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into the English language , they may be good, but not in this flop. you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes, thats how pathetic it is. then the rest is just bad . lots of waste of time, lots of UN-necessary plots. Oh did i mention one of the Baldwins' is in this.","The movie's casting choices, with American actors in Spain and Spanish actors speaking English, contribute to a disconnect that makes the acting annoying. The weak dialogue suggests a potential mistranslation from a Spanish script, and the predictability of the plot within the first few minutes leads to a sense of disappointment. Additionally, the film is criticized for the presence of unnecessary subplots and a lack of engaging content."
What makes this movie not worth watching?,"If you haven't seen this yet, I say just move on, take a walk in the park, don't waste your time. Neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money. *Spoilers*- I can't decide which was worse: The movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very questionable I hope she can improve it over time. The storyline is just unbelievable. Loose cannon American cop fighting criminals in Europe on his own?? Infamous Slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks??? An emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang??? Spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers??? Give me a break. There's only one good thing about this movie, though: At least, the production costs must be lower than ""Ocean's 12""'s which was as meaningless and over the top as this one.","The movie fails to deliver with a weak storyline, unconvincing acting, and unbelievable scenarios. From loose cannon American cops single-handedly fighting European criminals to infamous Slavic mafiosi being protected by only two individuals, the plot is hard to buy into. Additionally, the performances, especially Ellen Pompeo's, leave much to be desired. The production costs may be low, but the overall quality of the movie disappoints."
How did the director manage to mishandle such a phenomenal story of Olympic success?,"Don't get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics it was Dan.<br /><br />But how can it be possible that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible Dan Jansen story, because the real Dan Jansen story is truly incredible! Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong, the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate, their technique, the dimensions of the speedskating oval, it is all wrong!<br /><br />Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, a lot better!<br /><br />1 out of 10","The movie completely misses the mark in portraying the incredible story of speed skater Dan Jansen. From the inaccuracies in skating technique to the unrealistic depiction of the sport, the movie fails to do justice to the inspiring real-life events it is based on. Director Bill Corcoran disappoints by delivering a subpar representation of Dan Jansen's triumph, leading to a disheartening viewing experience. With numerous shortcomings, this film receives a dismal rating of 1 out of 10."
What are some of the main criticisms of this film?,"This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth, but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches. The daughter who secretly drops out of college, an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job (and first ends up with fairly demeaning work), the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance, the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs, etc. There is nothing really wrong with any of these, i.e. they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja-vu and too few surprises.","This film is criticized for being too focused on the lead actors, especially Mary Tyler Moore, at the expense of the rest of the cast. Additionally, the script is overloaded with cliches, making the storyline predictable and lacking in surprises. The various character arcs, such as the daughter dropping out of college and the journalist standing up for her beliefs, feel overdone and fail to bring anything fresh to the table."
Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour and why was there very little reference to the original show and characters in the movie?,"Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and characters? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting. Why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why couldn't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again.","The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting, making it seem like a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. It could have been much better and lacked the presence of other beloved characters like Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens. The reunion could have been more nostalgic and enjoyable."
"What elements of the film failed to meet the expectations of the viewer?

Negative","Watched on Hulu (far too many commercials!) so it broke the pacing but even still, it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews. They cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them I usually enjoy Indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment, especially for a modern Indian film. The story doesn't take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India) but I can't find out where it is supposed to be happening.","The excessive commercials on Hulu disrupted the pacing of the movie, making it difficult to fully engage with the storyline. The portrayal of characters in a stereotypical manner, showcasing all males as venal and all women as shrews, was disappointing and could be considered offensive. Additionally, the film's use of western models and music videos to cater to western audiences felt opportunistic and out of place in the context of a modern Indian film. The ambiguous setting of the story further added to the confusion and left the viewer feeling disconnected from the narrative."
What could have been done to improve this film?,"i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan(releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture) ,it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences.So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction.Give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than giving duds like garam masala!","This film was a major disappointment, lacking a coherent storyline and relying heavily on objectifying the debut actresses and cheap comedy. The director's repetitive style reminds one of past failures from other directors. It's high time for Priyadarshan to focus on better scripts and offer fresh content to the audience instead of delivering disappointing movies. Give us more comedy hits like 'Hera Pheri' and 'Malamaal Weekly', and avoid duds like 'Garam Masala'."
Was the movie able to deliver on the promising start?,"It begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations.<br /><br />Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam's (John Abraham) characters are not properly built before Mac's boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess. Rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations which at times seem forced.<br /><br />About the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture & Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the movie. <br /><br />The second half of the movie is funny at times, but in all a DUD (songs are boring) and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy.","The movie quickly loses its charm and fails to live up to expectations. The characters lack depth, the storyline feels forced, and the performances, except for Rajpal Yadav, are disappointing. The second half, while sporadically funny, ultimately falls flat. Overall, the movie is a dud with boring songs and is a major let down for those seeking genuine entertainment and comedy."
What were some of the major issues you noticed while watching the movie?,"Probably the worst Bollywood film I've seen.<br /><br />No plot line. Very little character developments.<br /><br />Full of silly and pointless humor. The whole film was chaotic and direction-less. There was no proper ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall. <br /><br />Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say ""please, just move on with it!!"" Even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days.<br /><br />Btw I'm not from an Indian background<br /><br />2/10","The movie lacked a coherent plotline, proper character development, and meaningful humor, making it seem direction-less and chaotic. The setting was unconvincing, with the airport scene filmed in a shopping mall. The repetitive storyline and poorly choreographed dance sequences added to the overall disappointment. The only saving grace was the attractive cast, but that's a common element in Bollywood movies nowadays. Overall, this film failed to impress, earning a low rating of 2 out of 10."
What were some criticisms of the movie?,"The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick, a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very loud over acting by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the movie, Paresh Rawal did well but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer. save your money and don't watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again!<br /><br />summarising it: a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance, the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! movie shot all in one room, new comers (female cast) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like Akshey and John totally disappointed an established director like Priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever!","The pacing of the film drastically changed after the first half-hour, with a weak justification for a character's actions leading to a messy storyline. Over-the-top acting by Akshey Kumar and John Abraham was distracting, overshadowing the better performances by Neha Dupia and Paresh Rawal. The movie overall felt like a big letdown compared to the promising trailer, lacking substance and coherence. Many viewers would be better off rewatching better films like Hera Pheri and Hungama rather than wasting their money on this disappointing production."
What were some of the shortcomings in the movie 'The Return'?,"The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such dismal standards. Poor screenplay(almost non existent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer. some of the scenes were funny, but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration. The editing was pathetic. Dismal! overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident. In fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval.<br /><br />One wouldn't miss anything at all if you don't watch the movie. Not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie. wait till it appears on TV...","The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such dismal standards. Poor screenplay, bad songs playing too frequently, and odd song sequences killed any potential humor. Only a few funny scenes were present, amounting to a mere 5 minutes of the film. The editing was poor, and the lack of a coherent story made the movie a letdown. Many viewers left after the interval, indicating the lack of engagement. It's not worth spending money on this movie, better to wait for it to air on TV."
What makes the film's script disappointing?,"The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's untimely death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramatics. In a 19th century castle in Southeastern Europe, a Countess falls for her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt; she's aided by her ancestor, whose painted image magically comes to life. Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh--or entertain. The results are good-looking, but unabsorbing. *1/2 from ****","The movie's script, adapted from an operetta, is a jumble of ideas that never come together successfully, leading to a lackluster and unengaging viewing experience."
Would you recommend this movie to others?,"Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable, particularly from ""Down Argentine Way"", but by the time she got around to this disaster, she had also got ""round"" and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been fairly desperate) the story was bad, the colours good, and the film far too long. It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success. The music score was woeful, and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way....as I was such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wish I had never seen this one!","This movie was a total disappointment. Despite some well-known actors in the cast, the storyline was weak, the film dragged on for far too long, and the music score was forgettable. Even if you're a fan of Betty Grable, ""roundly"" avoid this disaster of a film."
Do you think the movie adequately represents the old western charm with its characters and storyline?,"I'm a big fan of the old westerns, and do not believe that Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy. fallen but virtuous woman, bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation, etc. I can't help but notice the last names of the writer and young ""actor"" who plays Granger's son. Any nepotism there? I've seen better acting in high school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I reached the 1000 words yet?","As a fan of old westerns, I was disappointed with the lackluster performances in this 1957 movie. Despite having well-known actors like Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger, the film falls flat with clichéd western tropes like the reformed gunfighter and the fallen woman. The young actor playing Granger's son delivers a forgettable performance, raising suspicions of nepotism. Even seasoned actor Chill Wills fails to breathe life into his character, coming off as a one-dimensional caricature. The movie fails to live up to the standards set by classic westerns, leaving much to be desired in terms of acting and originality."
"What was your overall opinion on the movie ""The Twilight Zone""?","The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now, it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />While I have scored many episodes 10, this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad. The writing was in fact embarrassingly bad. Two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode. After a while, it's apparent that they are the only two people left on Earth--as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion. Usually the twist at the end makes the episode great--this one killed it!","The Twilight Zone had some episodes that were highly acclaimed by die-hard fans, but this particular episode fell short in terms of writing and the twist ending, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience."
What elements of the show make it annoying and unbearable to watch?,Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it. I find it the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience. That way the laughter would show just how 'unfunny' the show is. However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast. It sickens me however to think that they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters. Why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me. That is all.,"The show is deemed as the most annoying program on TV due to its lack of humor in the jokes, unbearable canned laughter, and the overall annoying voices and style of the presenters. The absence of genuine laughter, paired with the constant shouting, makes the viewing experience less enjoyable for the audience."
Can you tell me about a movie that opens with a meteor crashing into a lake and unleashing a dinosaur?,"- The movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake. Unbeknownst to the locals, a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community.<br /><br />- What utter garbage. It's not that I mind the stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's everything else about the movie that bothers me. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is utterly ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but comic. Logic is non-existent. Any similarity between the ""scientists"" in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental. I could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie, but you get the idea. I feel it's fairly safe to call this disaster ""MST3K Worthy"".","This movie was a disaster with atrocious acting, ridiculous dialogue, and lack of logic. The stop-motion clay dinosaur was the least of its problems. It's safe to say this film is ""MST3K Worthy""."
What makes this movie one of the worst you've ever seen?,"This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it's EXTREMELY boring with lots of boring dialog and has some VERY annoying characters and a laughable looking creature. The only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got. The plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale. No blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature, and a couple of bloody gunshot wounds. The acting is TERRIBLE!!. Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all!. Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was also NOT FUNNY!. Bob Hyman is decent but not much more then that. Richard Garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb what so ever. Kacey Cobb is so so here and had no chemistry with Richard. Overall Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! BOMB out of 5.","The movie was extremely boring with a lot of tedious dialogue and annoying characters, not to mention a laughable looking creature. The plot was ridiculous and the ending was as stupid as it gets. There was minimal blood, just a few bloody marks on the creature and a couple of gunshot wounds. The acting was terrible, with Richard Cardella's portrayal as the sheriff being laughable and annoying. Glen Roberts failed to provide any comic relief, Mark Siegel was annoying and not funny, and the chemistry between the actors was completely off. Overall, you should steer clear of this movie at all costs."
"What are some of the biggest shortcomings of ""The Crater Lake Monster""?","A meteor hit's Crater Lake (hence our title), awakening a Plesiosaur, who proceed's to snack on the hick population (in California, that hick capital of the world.) <br /><br />There's bad movies, and then there's ""The Crater Lake Monster"", which somehow managed to escape MST3K. Featuring grating acting, a decent stop-motion beast, and more, this is a dreadful piece of 1970's low budget exploitation/monster movie dreck.<br /><br />While the movie is guilty of many crimes, the biggest one is Arnie and Mitch, two obnoxious rednecks who serve as our comic relief. They bumble around, fight to stock ""banjo music"",ogle women, and act like pathetic excuses of humanity. The characters are so bad, they should count as a crime against humanity.","The acting is grating and the characters, like Arnie and Mitch, are obnoxious rednecks who add nothing but annoyance to the film. Their behavior is so dismal that it could be considered a crime against humanity."
Was the movie able to effectively build tension and fear in the audience?,"A handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation, but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth. No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses, who suddenly become the lead characters; but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - that's no fun!","The movie failed to deliver a sense of terror and suspense due to the lackluster prehistoric creature animation and the abrupt shift in focus to comic relief characters halfway through. The replacement of the monster with production assistants waving an inner tube with teeth was disappointing and did not contribute to a scary atmosphere. The humor attempted by the new lead characters fell flat, and the ending, where one character is eaten and the other is left crying, lacked impact and left the audience feeling unsatisfied."
What aspects of the film disappointed viewers according to one review?,"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is poor, particularly the leads. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. Their's may not be ""the true story,"" but it's a great film.","The script is tedious, the acting is poor, and the leads are particularly disappointing."
What are some criticisms of the movie?,"Here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel, poverty riddled existence: Robin Hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times. Gad! According to this crap Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want to hurt anybody....he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them. Badly acted, poorly filmed, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weaponry, gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bilgewater. Thumbs down. -5 stars.","The movie received a negative review stating that it was badly acted, poorly filmed, with unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weaponry, and gore that looked more like grape jelly. The reviewer advised to avoid watching this movie and gave it a thumbs down along with a rating of -5 stars."
Do you think the remake of this classic film lived up to the original version's excitement and innovation?,"Once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results. The title is false as is everything about this film. The period is not persuasively rendered, and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version strayed from the facts, presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting, and innovative for 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care. This 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow, unappealing, and not the least bit interesting. By all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better. Could it possibly be worse?","The remake of this classic film falls short in capturing the style, humor, and point of view that made the original memorable. The period setting lacks authenticity, the leads appear too young and shallow to be convincing as criminals, and overall, the film feels unnecessary and uninspiring. The actors in this version lack the charisma and depth to make you care about their characters. It's best to skip this lackluster remake and hope for a better adaptation in the future."
"Can you give a brief overview of the movie ""ZOMBIE BLOODBATH""?","OK, I really don't have too much to say about this film, other than this: I have seen over 4,000 films in my life, and more than 2,300 of those were horror films. While I have some difficulty deciding which is the best (as opposed to my favourite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror film I have ever seen.<br /><br />There is simply nothing positive I can say about this film. The acting, the dialogue, the directing, the make-up, the music... Every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released.<br /><br />Even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist, please heed my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage. There is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this. You won't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display... Trust me. Please.","I can assure you that ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is an absolute disaster of a film on every level. From the terrible acting to the laughable dialogue, incompetent directing, subpar make-up, and unbearable music, this movie fails to deliver even a modicum of entertainment. It is truly astonishing how a film this atrocious was ever allowed to see the light of day. Save yourself the agony and avoid wasting your time on this complete garbage of a horror movie."
What are some key issues that detracted from the overall quality of this movie?,"and a 30,000$ budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50$. You can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot, he was just happy to be making a zombie movie. <br /><br />What the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies. It could have been great if he just had of given a care. The end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore, and even more poorly produced metal plays over it.<br /><br />What happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work, and one idiot behind the camera.","Despite having a budget of $30,000, this movie appears cheaply made and lacks attention to details like continuity and plot development. The director's focus on making a zombie movie overshadowed the need for a coherent storyline, resulting in a lazy and unfulfilling viewing experience. The excessive use of poorly executed gore scenes and amateurish music choices further highlight the lack of care put into this production."
What are some major flaws in the movie mentioned in the reviews?,"Wow, this was a very bad movie... as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result.<br /><br />The editing of this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening.<br /><br />All in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all, has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad everything.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this.<br /><br />Unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find, do not watch this. Period.","The movie was criticized for having no plot, poor character development, lack of coherence in the editing, bad acting, unconvincing dialogue, and overall lack of thoughtful production. The only redeeming quality mentioned was the gore factor, which seemed to be the main focus of the filmmakers."
What are some of the shortcomings of the film as pointed out in the review?,"A terrible amateur movie director (no, not Todd Sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. The friend and sister fall in and get rescued. Meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'. Whatever the heck that means. This film and I use the term VERY loosely is so bad that it's.. well bad. The humor is painfully unfunny, the ""action"" merely sad. Now I've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films, yet I still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. ONLY for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away FAST!!<br /><br />My Grade: F","The film is described as terrible, with horribly acted characters and painfully unfunny humor. The action scenes are said to be sad, making it a painful watch even for those used to low-budget films. The reviewer strongly advises against watching this film, giving it a failing grade of F."
Would you recommend watching this movie?,"You wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good, and it isn't. It's a no budget, ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera...and it's hilarious. The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I've ever seen. It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts, and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. It's a funny and sickening film, and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB/****. 90 mins.","This movie is an absolute disaster. It's a low-budget, poorly made zombie film with terrible acting and a nonexistent plot. The shaky camera work only adds to the headache-inducing experience. The gore effects may be sickening, but they come off as more gruesome than impressive. Save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this mess of a movie."
What are some of the major issues with the film and its execution?,"A Vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok, and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated (including women). Released to theaters just prior to ""A Star Is Born"", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash starring Kris Kristofferson is wildly off-kilter, thoughtless and mean-spirited. Filmed in Simi Valley, CA, the results are truly unseemly, with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director George Armitage's script. Armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and, in a bit, Loni Anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson, who is gruff and rude throughout. It deserves points I suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) coat the whole project like an ugly stain. *1/2 from ****","The movie is a mess, lacking depth and taste, with an overemphasis on mindless violence and redneck stereotypes. The performances, especially Kris Kristofferson's, come off as gruff and unpleasant, failing to engage the audience. The plot is haphazardly put together, leading to a ridiculous and unsatisfying climax that taints the entire viewing experience. Overall, the film feels mean-spirited and thoughtless, leaving a bad taste in the viewer's mouth.*"
Did this short film from David Lynch effectively tell a compelling story on screen?,"In film, I feel as though it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on screen. This short from David Lynch tells a story but not much of one. I felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. It is good film-making but there really isn't anything else to it. As I've said before, I am a huge David Lynch fan but I get frustrated by some of his work because I don't see a need for it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know he's still got a ton of talent and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much.","This short film from David Lynch falls short in delivering a coherent story, leaving viewers feeling perplexed by its strange and comedic elements. While Lynch's unique style of filmmaking is evident, the lack of a clear narrative makes it hard for audiences to connect with the film. Fans of Lynch may appreciate his artistry, but for those seeking a meaningful story, this short may disappoint."
What makes Dumbland fail to impress viewers despite its absurdist qualities?,"Lynch. The man has some really great stuff! He knows how to disturb us, then reward us by getting us think in different ways. This, however, is altogether different. Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. I may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 I just started watching on fast-forward. Didn't miss a thing. I felt relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point with this series. It's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded out with annoying animation, voices and sound. But recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make Dumbland worthwhile.","Dumbland is an annoying series featuring annoying characters, annoying situations, annoying animation, and annoying sound. It offers very little in terms of rewarding comedy, with 99% of its content being categorized as stupidity. Many viewers found themselves fast-forwarding through episodes and feeling relieved when it finally came to an end, failing to see any value in enduring such annoyance."
"After reading a positive review by a David Lynch fan, it seems like this particular release was a disappointment to them. Can you provide a negative review for the same movie?","I am a great fan of David Lynch and have everything that he's made on DVD except for Hotel Room & the 2 hour Twin Peaks movie. So, when I found out about this, I immediately grabbed it and...and...what IS this? It's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny. Maybe I don't know what's good, but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks, too. Let me make it clear that I didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. All in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity. I highly recommend you don't spend your money on this. 2 out of 10.","I grabbed this expecting something in line with David Lynch's unique style, but what I got was a load of poorly drawn, loud, and unfunny cartoons that felt like a cheap attempt to make a quick buck. The foul language was not an issue for me, but the lack of creativity and entertainment value left me constantly adjusting the sound out of sheer annoyance. This release would probably be better off left as a forgotten addition to a box set rather than something to spend your hard-earned money on. 2 out of 10."
What aspects of the movie did the viewer find disappointing?,OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with. Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list. I don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie. I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me. As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best. Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning. How does that scare someone? I can make that noise easily. Now don't get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad.,"The viewer found the movie to be lacking in scares, with only two jump scenes that were not very effective. They also mentioned that the sound effects were more comical than frightening, with the weird groaning noise being particularly unimpressive. Additionally, they were puzzled by the inclusion of a seemingly random character, the catboy, and overall felt the movie was extremely predictable and not even enjoyable in a so-bad-it's-good way."
Is this movie truly as bad as people say it is?,"This movie may seem scary on commercials, but the actual movie was a reason to vomit. This is a below below average, (even lower than that) and has no plot. I mean every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead Japanese woman would scare the poop out of you, but so what? Make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say ""horrible rip-off of Samara (The Ring)""? Don't get me started with the ""dead child"". Not even that scary! So what? He has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the Grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >.<","The movie is a complete disaster. It fails to deliver any meaningful plot and relies too heavily on jump scares and tired cliches. The attempt to make it frightening falls flat, coming across as a cheap imitation of better horror films. The characters lack depth, and the scares feel forced and ineffective. The film is a wasted opportunity that leaves viewers feeling disappointed and underwhelmed."
Was this horror movie enjoyable for fans of the genre?,"My husband and I went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are. Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. I found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US. My advice: If you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one. I can't really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.","Unfortunately, this horror movie failed to deliver a truly terrifying experience for the audience. The scares felt more comical than frightening, leaving viewers disappointed. It seems that the essence of fear that Japanese horror writers capture might not resonate well with American audiences. Overall, this film fell short in providing the expected chills and thrills, making it hard to recommend to true horror enthusiasts."
What are some major shortcomings of The Grudge according to the review?,"Okay, if you've seen The Ring, you've basically seen The Grudge. It's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for instance, how would the care center have known that Yoko didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it more.","The reviewer expressed disappointment with the movie's attempt at creating scares through camera tricks and loud sounds, with lack of clarity and coherence in the plot. The reviewer pointed out various holes in the storyline such as inexplicable character connections and unanswered questions, leading to a feeling of boredom and dissatisfaction."
"Can you briefly describe the movie ""The Grudge""?","This movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable ""gotcha!"" at the end of each. Really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of. There are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms. It's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid (who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like ""The Ring"") take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out, two-dimensional excuses for human characters.<br /><br />This English-language version of ""The Grudge"" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you ought to be living on.<br /><br />Not recommended.","This movie lacks character development and a cohesive plot, relying heavily on cheap scares with a creepy ghost kid and his ghost mom. The story feels shallow and the characters are poorly developed, making it feel like a subpar version of the original film. Overall, ""The Grudge"" is not recommended for those looking for a meaningful cinematic experience."
"What makes this movie a waste of time?  
Negative","this movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I were payed to. The so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played. There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7.50 I payed to see it. Don't go see it, don't rent it, don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible, horrible movie. Horrible movie, no need to ever see it.","This movie was a total bore, lacking any originality and filled with predictable and overplayed horror scenes. The lead actress, Sarah Michelle Geller, delivered a lackluster performance, tarnishing her reputation with her association to this dreadful film. Save your money and steer clear of this disaster."
What are some of the reasons why this movie was a major disappointment to the audience?,"Wow, what a total let down! The fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of ""The ring."" The story? Was there one? Not in my opinion..Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I have seen in years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of Barbie! I suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was PG-13, and had it been rated R, it would have bombed IMO! Stupid movie!","The movie failed to deliver on its promise of being a scary horror film, instead resorting to unoriginal special effects reminiscent of another movie. The storyline was nearly non-existent, leaving viewers with nothing but flashy visuals. The film was described as boring, stupid, and a mess, with criticisms towards the lead actress for her lackluster performance. Overall, it was deemed as one of the worst horror films in years and only survived due to a good marketing campaign and a PG-13 rating that appealed to younger viewers."
"What makes ""The Grudge"" fail to deliver a truly scary experience for viewers?","Gee, what a crappy movie this was! I cannot understand what people find so scary about ""The Grudge"". The director plays one trick (I'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. To conclude, I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor ""The Ring"" was way scarier and that buying a ticket for ""The Grudge"" is a waste of money.","The movie relies heavily on a single scare tactic that quickly becomes repetitive, causing the once-startling moments to feel predictable and dull. Compared to other films in the same genre like ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"" falls short in delivering genuine scares and fails to justify its price of admission."
Was this movie worth the hype and promotion it received?,"If you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre, the director, the producer, the actors and the person that told you to go see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. It may have been more scary if the Japanese actors would have just spoken in Japanese instead of attempting to 'act' in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended...a true disappointment after all of the hype on TV and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie...she just practiced her frowning skills. Don't waste your time or money on this film.","This movie was a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. The acting was poor, the plot was weak, and the attempted scares fell flat. It's a shame that Sarah Michelle Geller's name was attached to this lackluster film. Save yourself the trouble and avoid watching this one."
Why do some people feel that this movie is highly overrated and a waste of time?,"All the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). They have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it. I feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. This was one of the worst movies i saw in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And the end? It's an open ending... why? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. This movie is just made to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some about music, you exactly know when you'll be scared. <br /><br />When the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told (a bit to loud) him that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid looked strange at me. These day i could make an Oscar with a home-video of my goldfish, if only i use the right marketing.","This movie seems to heavily rely on clichés and unoriginal scenes, leaving viewers feeling disappointed and unimpressed. The storyline lacks depth and originality, resulting in a predictable and unsatisfying viewing experience. Additionally, the open ending feels like a cop-out rather than a thought-provoking conclusion. Overall, it appears that the movie prioritizes cheap scares over genuine substance, leaving many viewers questioning its appeal."
Did The Grudge manage to deliver a truly terrifying horror experience?,"Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments.<br /><br />If one forgets the (failed) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie, he is again disappointed. The acting is OK but not great. The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning, while one is trying to get what's happening. But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand. ""Scary"" elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason...<br /><br />So... (yawn) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds.","The Grudge falls short in delivering scares and fails to maintain a suspenseful atmosphere throughout the movie. The attempts at horror are weak and only manage to elicit minimal jump scares. The acting is mediocre and the plot starts off intriguing but quickly loses its appeal as it becomes apparent that there is little substance to it. The inclusion of ""scary"" elements feels forced and arbitrary, adding to the overall disappointment. Watching this movie may leave you feeling unimpressed and unengaged, making it a lackluster choice for a horror film."
What makes this movie a disappointing watch despite the intriguing premise and a talented cast?,"Freeway Killer, Is a Madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone. The police believe he is a random killer, but Sunny, the blond heroine, played by Darlanne Fluegel detects a pattern. So does the ex-cop, played by James Russo, and they join forces, and bodies, in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses. Also starring Richard Belzer, this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases, but its really not a good movie for the most part, check it out if you're really bored and have already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride, or Breakdown, otherwise stay away from the freeway.","Even though Freeway Killer has some exciting car chase scenes and a decent cast including James Russo and Darlanne Fluegel, it falls short in overall quality. The plot feels forced, the dialogue is cheesy, and the pacing is uneven. The attempts at suspense and mystery don't quite hit the mark, leaving the viewer feeling underwhelmed. While the film may offer a few fleeting moments of entertainment, it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling story or memorable characters. If you're looking for a captivating thriller, this movie is better left unwatched."
Did the movie Wonderland manage to provide a comprehensive and meaningful portrayal of the events that took place in 1981?,"Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film. It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it's impossible to get any dimensions from them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton.","Wonderland failed to delve deep into the storyline and failed to showcase the full extent of the incidents that occurred in 1981. The performances from the cast, including Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, were lacking depth and authenticity. Kilmer's portrayal of John Holmes felt uninspired and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth's roles were unconvincing. The supporting cast members were underutilized, making it difficult for the audience to connect with the characters. Overall, Wonderland fell short of creating a compelling and engaging narrative."
"How does the film ""Wonderland"" handle the depiction of violence and its overall tone?","I am wanting to make a ""Holmes with Doors"" pun but I can't quite string it all together. Suitably grubby and over edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time....but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead.....as someone famous said once about US cinema double standards: ""kiss a breast and it's an X, stab it and its an action PG 13""... WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long too, and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobble-cam gets tiresome, as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time. Taking a few cues form THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER it all becomes forgettable the next day.","The film ""Wonderland"" is criticized for being coy and unnecessarily lengthy, with a tawdry spiral that leaves viewers glad to leave the cinema. The excessive wobble-cam technique makes it tiresome to watch, and despite attempting to channel the style of ""The Doors"" and ""Taxi Driver,"" the film ultimately falls flat and becomes forgettable."
"What is the overall tone of the movie ""Wonderland""?","Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very engaging actors giving decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Infamous for his well-endowments, a drug addict, and a guy who, despite contracting AIDS, continued to make adult films, just does not make an intriguing character.<br /><br />The story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in Los Angelos to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and who ultimately was acquitted. Just like in the case of O.J., the guilt factor, regardless of the outcome, ranged quite high in the ""He did it"" zone.<br /><br />There is no one to sympathize with in this film, as everyone is a self-serving criminal. There is just nothing remotely interesting here.","The performances of Val Kilmer, Dylan McDermott, and Josh Lucas are commendable, but the lack of a compelling plot centered around the unlikable character of John Holmes makes it difficult to become invested in the story. The focus on a brutal mass murder and the unsympathetic nature of all the characters leaves the audience with little to engage with."
"What made ""Wonderland"" such a disappointing film?","The plot certainly seemed interesting enough. How can a real-life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie? Well, you can watch ""Wonderland"" and find out.<br /><br />I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is zero character development, so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the direction was very tedious. This all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie.<br /><br />Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters.","The plot lacks depth and character development, leaving viewers unable to connect with or understand the motivations of the characters involved in the real-life events. The pace of the movie is slow and tedious, resulting in a dull and uninteresting viewing experience. The potential for real insight into the characters is missed, making the movie overall quite boring."
What aspects of the film failed to live up to its intriguing premise?,"The premise was intriguing, but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it. The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect.... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial), characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage (and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story. A very forgettable film.","The direction of the film was inconsistent with overused stylistic editing, lack of character development beyond drug usage, and unrelatable characters that made it forgettable."
What kind of audience would find this movie appealing?,"This is the only movie I have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site, and that is a significant statement from someone who likes ""The Attack of the Monolith Monsters."" This movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie. It is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged, or stimulated in any way. Adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the TV while the kids watch this movie. Don't be surprise ,however, if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the TV off and started a board game. As an adult who enjoys being entertained, who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism, drama, comedy, and action, all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and/or stimulate the imagination, this movie has nothing to offer.","The movie was described as inoffensive and devoid of any stimulating content, making it suitable for children, but lacking entertainment value for adults. It was criticized for being bland and unengaging, with some viewers finding it so underwhelming that it could put them to sleep."
What demographic do you think this movie caters to?,I saw this in the market place at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /><br />It's a real cheapo prod - nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both. <br /><br />Think Larry Cohen. <br /><br />Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers for hooking her I guess.<br /><br />The opening scene in the space-ship coming down is hilarious - you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around! <br /><br />Ha ha - but I wish the people who made this well - at least it's not pretentious.,"The movie leans heavily on cheap production value and lacks substance, relying on outdated tropes of sex and gore to compensate. Despite the presence of talented actors like Sean Young, the overall execution falls flat, highlighted by a laughable opening scene that fails to set the tone. The film comes across as more of a forced attempt at entertainment rather than a meaningful cinematic experience."
Do you think the movie is worth watching?,"The movie's premise is spooky: a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar.<br /><br />But as soon as the movie begins, a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a C type Sci-Fi TV movie. It's a big Star Trek and a bit X-files, but more than anything else it's boring.<br /><br />When the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche. It looked more like a 2 parter in a bad Sci-Fi TV series. No suspense and no thrills, but not for a lack of trying. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.","The movie's premise may seem intriguing at first glance, but the execution falls flat. The opening scene sets the tone for a dull and predictable storyline that lacks suspense and fails to deliver any thrills. The film feels more like a low-budget Sci-Fi TV episode than a captivating movie, with cliched conflicts between the main characters making it even more uninteresting. Save your time and skip this one."
How did the movie's ending affect the overall viewing experience for the reviewer?,"I actually liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and butchers the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song. My ears bled! And, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!","The movie was enjoyable for the most part, but the final scene where the main character completely ruins a classical piece by turning it into a pop song was cringeworthy and out of place. The reviewer found this abrupt change jarring and disappointing, and felt that it detracted from the movie as a whole."
Could the movie be any more predictable and unbelievable than this?,"can any movie become more naive than this? you cant believe a piece of this script. and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes. the leading actress seems like she wants to be Barbie (but she doesn't make it, the doll has MORE acting skills).<br /><br />the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the ONE good thing of the film is Madsen's performance which manages to bring life to a melo-like one-dimensional character.<br /><br />The movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth. i can think some 13 year old Britney-obsessed girls shouting ""O, do give us a break! If we want fairy tales there is always the Brothers Grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic"". I gave it 2 instead of one only for Virginia Madsen.","The script is so naive and unconvincing that it's hard to take seriously. The leading actress comes across as trying to be a Barbie doll with poor acting skills. The plot and ending are so obvious that they can be guessed within the first 10 minutes. The ease with which the character gets into a music school makes the Phantom of the Opera novel seem like a historical biography. The characters are shallow and the film is filled with cheesy moments that feel cringeworthy. Overall, it's a disappointing watch except for Madsen's performance."
"What about the ending of the movie? Do you think it wrapped up the story well? 

Negative","It was a decent movie, I actually kind of enjoyed it. But the ending is so abrupt!! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What happens with her boyfriend? Does she hook up with Grant? Does she come beck in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously Holly's performance would knock Angela down a few pegs, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts. There is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying. I don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it is a terrible ending and I think that it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.","The ending was extremely disappointing. It felt rushed and left way too many loose ends, making the whole viewing experience unsatisfying. There was no closure for the characters or the plot, leaving the audience frustrated and feeling like they wasted their time. The lack of resolution made the movie feel incomplete and it failed to deliver a satisfying conclusion."
"Why did the filmmakers choose to film in a location completely different from where the actual events occurred in Grand Island, Nebraska?","This film, although not totally bad, should have been filmed where the actual events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is situated in the nearly treeless, flat Platte River Valley in Hall county. The makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of Ontario and moved the whole event to a non-existant town called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie.","One major flaw of this film was the decision to film in Ontario instead of in Grand Island, Nebraska where the true events unfolded. This significant deviation from the actual setting resulted in a disconnect from the reality of the devastating events of that night in 1980. It failed to effectively capture the essence and impact of the tornadoes on the people of Grand Island, and by relocating the story to a fictional town, it detracted from the authenticity and emotional depth of the narrative."
What makes this movie fall short for audience members who are tired of the same old romantic comedy formula?,"Formula flick of guy who wants girl, guy who will lie to get next to girl, guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way (comedus reliefus, no?) to help deceive girl, etc. This one's been done to death, and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings, it's been done better.<br /><br />Stale plot aside, the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments. Jonathon Schaech has done better, and his acting here came close to being phoned in. Not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this tepid affair.","The plot feels worn out and lacking originality, with lead actors failing to bring anything exceptional to their performances. It seems like a recycled concept with few standout moments, ultimately making it a forgettable and uninspiring watch."
What are the main criticisms of the film?,"Yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again we have an attractive 'straight' hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him. Yeah, right! And we're also presented with the 'sympathetic, attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat, balding, ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive. Even I didn't find him appealing and I'm a fat, ugly old gay man (but thankfully not balding)! Whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script, and truly awful direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from filmdom, but then he's no different than the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed.","The movie is criticized for relying on offensive stereotypes and promoting unappealing characters based on sexual orientation. The humor falls flat, and the acting is wasted on a poorly written script and direction. The film has been slammed for lacking originality and resorting to clichés."
Can you provide a negative review of the movie?,"This horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic all at once, while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. Atrocious performances, a cliche ridden screenplay, and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of. Two scenes were especially offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (could it really have been that gross), and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend, who is pretending to be Russian. After he leaves the room she exclaims ""f**king foreigners""! So much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris!?!<br /><br />Jonathon Schaech can be a likeable actor on screen, and is astonishingly good-looking. It's a shame he didn't learn more from working with cutting edge gay director Gregg Araki on an earlier film, and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia.","This movie is an absolute disaster, filled with offensive stereotypes and intolerant viewpoints. The performances are terrible, the plot is unoriginal, and the direction is downright boring. It tries to be chic and sophisticated but ends up being incredibly racist, sexist, and homophobic. Stay far away from this trainwreck of a film."
What makes this Twilight Zone episode stand out as the worst in the series?,"They played this on the July 4th Twilight Zone marathon and this is, hands down, the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Even though Twilight Zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable, this one was completely out of place. Compare this to legendary episodes like ""A Stop at Willoughby"" or ""Midnight Sun"", and you realize there is no comparison.<br /><br />Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode. Even though he seemed to be giving it some effort, he MUST have needed the money... there's no other explanation.","This Twilight Zone episode stands out as the worst due to its lack of consistency with the rest of the series in tone and its predictable nature. It fails to measure up to legendary episodes like ""A Stop at Willoughby"" or ""Midnight Sun"", making it a disappointing addition. Even Buster Keaton's efforts couldn't salvage the poor material, leaving viewers questioning why such a comedy icon would be part of this subpar episode."
What are the major flaws in the remake of Gone in 60 Seconds?,"The remake of H.B. Halicki's classic seventies chase film is simply horrible. Along with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds represent the quintessential car chase films. The remake takes the original and stands it on its head. Whereas Halicki gave us 75% car chase and 25% supporting drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% car chase and 75% supporting drama. Cage as super man, saves his brother, kisses the girl. MTV edits, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki didn't live to see his baby (he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the '74' film) degraded in this manner.","The remake of Gone in 60 Seconds is a complete disappointment compared to the original. Instead of focusing on thrilling car chase scenes, the film prioritizes unnecessary supporting drama. Additionally, the MTV-style editing and superficial elements like sexual content only add to the disappointment. Save your money and watch the original instead."
Can you clarify the point that the movie accurately depicts the geography of Iraq?,"I read the comment of Chris_m_grant from United States.<br /><br />He wrote : "" A Fantastic documentary of 1924. This early 20th century geography of today's Iraq was powerful.""<br /><br />I would like to thank Chris and people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran, the Zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie Grass, A Nation's battle for life. These traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures. I am from this region of Iran myself. I am a Bakhtiari. <br /><br />Chris, I am sorry to bother you but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Irak as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Irak are two different and distinct countries. Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like taking an American for an Mexican. Thanks,<br /><br />Ziba","While the documentary ""Grass, A Nation's battle for life"" offers a fascinating insight into the Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran and the landscapes of the Zagros mountains, it seems to have confused viewers regarding the geography of Iraq. Despite its captivating portrayal of ancient traditions, the inaccurate portrayal of the region may mislead viewers and detract from the overall viewing experience."
What was your opinion on the cinematography and plot of the movie?,"Documentary about nomadic Persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass. Watching this silent, black and white feature, marred in part by a twink-twink-twink Oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition, is even duller than it sounds. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen, and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but despised this movie, notwithstanding the similarity of the theme. Physical hardships alone are just not that interesting.","The documentary failed to captivate the audience due to its dull presentation, lack of engaging plot, and poor choice of music that did not match the original atmosphere. The black and white visuals on a small screen took away from the beauty of the scenery, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience. This film fell short of capturing the audience's attention and failed to establish a compelling storyline to keep viewers engaged."
What is the main issue you had with the movie?,"The problem I find with this title is that I am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie. A blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere. This is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary. If it is meant to be a thriller/drama this is too dull and monotonous. In either case, what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience? That around us there are people who ill-treat others who are willing to be ill-treated? That there are many crazy lunatics around us? So..........so what?","The blend of documentary and movie genres in this title does not work well, leaving the film feeling unconvincing in its portrayal of everyday life. The lack of a clear message or moral to convey to the audience makes it difficult to fully engage with the content."
What makes this film stand out from conventional entertainment movies?,"This film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour. Loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film. For me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode, closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the 'slags' flat. You will be gripped and I hope horrified by this film. I hated it but I felt compelled to see it through. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 for displaying 'man' as he sometimes is.","This movie is not a fun watch at all; it delves deeply into the darkest aspects of humanity, showcasing depravity, perverted behavior, greed, violence, and intolerance. The interconnected stories of various characters during a sweltering heatwave in Vienna may leave viewers feeling disturbed rather than entertained. The portrayal of the mistreatment of a mentally challenged girl and the graphic scenes of drunkenness and perversion can be deeply unsettling. While it may be an eye-opening experience, it lacks the enjoyment factor and may leave viewers feeling repulsed rather than engaged."
Can the film effectively capture real-life struggles without making the audience likeable?,"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature. I did not like the movie but I cannot say that it is a bad movie, it is just special. I reminds me also of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"" where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: the hell is on this world.","This movie was a displeasing experience; the characters were portrayed in an unlikable and vulgar manner, lacking any sense of decency or relatability. The overall atmosphere of the movie felt forced and unenjoyable, making it difficult to connect with the storyline or the personalities depicted on screen. The film seemed to pride itself on being unconventional and edgy, but it ended up feeling more like a pretentious attempt at depth rather than a genuine exploration of human nature."
What can you expect from the storyline and pace of this film?,"If you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the film for you. If you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many films that do this far better. For example, try some of the darker films by Bergman. The Filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end. If you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your house, for example.","The film fails to captivate the audience with its storyline, portraying a dull and unexciting depiction of middle class lives. It lacks engaging elements and instead presents a series of tedious and uninteresting events, leading to a dissatisfying and uninspiring conclusion. It is suggested to explore other films for a more compelling viewing experience."
What makes this movie a complete disaster?,"What an appalling piece of rubbish!!! Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is? Yes, it's ""arty""; and yes, it's ""foreign"", but .... that's not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show but not so slickly made.<br /><br />The people are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people then I feel very, very sorry for them.<br /><br />The violence (and some of it is very violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous. It's like the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think very much of him, either.<br /><br />And oh yes: if I had neighbours like these, I'd move!","This film is an absolute mess! The storyline is so dull and all over the place, making it feel like a poorly made reality show. The characters are incredibly boring and lack any depth, making it impossible to care about their journey. The violence comes off as flashy and unnecessary, almost like a failed attempt to mimic Quentin Tarantino's style. Overall, the film fails to engage the audience and leaves a lot to be desired."
What are some criticisms of the movie?,"This movie sucks ass. Something about a heatwave in some European country, complete trash. There's nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it. There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. This movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it. I regret it it's very boring. I would rate it zero but i can't. No body in their right mind should see this. i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did. How could they think up something this bad. Even Mystery men was better. MYSTERY MEN. That sucks. That movie wasn't worth being made. complete waste of time. The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored.","This movie is a complete waste of time. The storyline about a heatwave in some European country is trash and lacks any engaging elements. There is minimal content with only a brief moment of sex, and the presence of an irritating character ruins the viewing experience. The movie is incredibly boring, with poorly developed characters and a confusing plot. Overall, watching this film would likely lead to regret and disappointment."
What makes the character of Bake Baker in 'Follow the Fleet' different from other Fred Astaire characters?,"Despite being a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' movies, it wasn't until about 6 years ago that I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'. I knew all the songs from an old Astaire/Rogers record (yes, vinyl) but knew nothing of the plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and Ginger Rogers' character is sweet and funny, you just can't like 'Bake Baker'. While trying to make up to his longtime partner, he continually sabotages her career. His character doesn't have the usual humour and elan of the other films' Astaire characters.<br /><br />Worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers.","Bake Baker's character in 'Follow the Fleet' lacks the usual humor and charm seen in other Fred Astaire films, making it hard to genuinely like his character as he continually sabotages his partner's career."
What makes the movie feel like a chore to watch?,"Despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch. The murder-mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving. Although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed. It's obviously a pre-code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there's even a song singing the praises of marijuana! The performances are all one-note although it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical but when Victor McLaglen, as the police Lieutenent, lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues, you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast-forward to the next number. Pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though!","The murder-mystery plot is simply a backdrop for the musical numbers which are poorly staged and the performances are one-note, making the film lack engagement. The overtly risque content, including scantily clad girls and a song glorifying marijuana, may not appeal to all viewers. The presence of Victor McLaglen's character becoming repetitive adds to the lackluster experience, leaving some audience members feeling like they wanted to fast-forward or even leave the cinema."
What are some reasons people may find this film disappointing?,"This film is terrible. Every line is stolen from 8MM (the Italian dubbed version, at least). If you like trash... real trash, give it a try; but beware: this ain't the ""so bad it's good"" kind of flick. In its cheapness, it may really look like a porno but, believe me, if you're looking for ""snuff"", s & m, hardcore, softcore... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in store! I'm telling you this, 'cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, plot, dialogues (the only good lines, as I said before, are the ones they stolen from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the ""happy ending"" is absolutely revolting! I'll give it one star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after ""the eyes of the victim"" monologue (stolen from 8MM as well) and a half for mom & daughter's sexy bodies (that didn't manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)","The film is filled with unoriginal dialogue stolen from another movie, resulting in a lackluster plot, uninspired acting, and unconvincing scenes. Viewers looking for any type of sensuality or genuine entertainment will be let down by the overall cheap and dull presentation. The attempt to create an edgy vibe akin to genres like ""snuff"" or erotic thrillers falls flat, making it a tedious watch that may leave you feeling bored and unsatisfied."
What makes this film fall short of expectations?,"Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie.Even if B. Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it.This film is just empty, nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.No sex, no blood(it's suppose to be about snuff?),no actors, no dialogs, just as bad as an 90'T.V film.It's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.So Rest in peace Bruno, you will stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as:Zombi 3, Robowar,Rats, l'altro inferno,Virus, Cruel jaws and few others.So except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Franco's spirit's new film, pass on this one.But if you don't know this nice artisan's career track down his old films and have fun.","Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver on any level. With no engaging plot, lack of any exciting elements like sex or blood, absence of good actors or meaningful dialogue, it falls flat from the beginning. It feels more like a low-quality TV film from the 90s rather than a worthwhile watch. It seems like the director has lost his touch over the past decade, making it even worse than his previous works. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one."
What makes this movie fall into the category of B-Grade films and not live up to credible standards?,"Well what can I say, there are B-Grade Movies and there are B-Grade Movies and this definitely falls into the latter. However since it's obvious that even the makers of the film know that it's not a credible movie (take a look at the closing credits) it can be forgiven.<br /><br />The plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed. He accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes on the form of a snowman - if you can believe that. The snowman, Jack Frost, is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars. In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half the town.<br /><br />This movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the B-Grade movies of the 50's. This alone makes it worth watching for a laugh. A movie to pass the time away.","The plot of the film revolves around a convicted psycho killer who turns into a snowman seeking revenge on a small-town sheriff, resulting in half the town getting killed. The lack of real scares coupled with outdated special effects reminiscent of B-Grade movies from the 50s make it more of a comedic watch rather than a thrilling one."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find disappointing?,It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audiences. It's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well I'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman.,"The movie was a complete letdown due to the terrible direction, horrible script, and numerous mistakes throughout. The reviewer found it agonizing to watch and did not see any fun in it. The constant pointing out of errors and cringeworthy one-liners made the experience even worse."
What makes this movie stand out from other horror films?,"You know what kind of movie you're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair (in what seems to be a bakery truck), only to have the prison vehicle collide with (and I'm not making this up) a genetic engineering tanker truck. The goo which spurts forth melts him, and fuses his DNA with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman.<br /><br />My favorite portion of the movie, however, is an over-the-shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck, in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven-potholder gloves.<br /><br />Mmmmm, schlock...","This movie is pure kitschy nonsense, with a laughable premise and absurd special effects. The cheesy over-the-top scenes only add to the ridiculousness of the plot, making it impossible to take seriously. The lack of any real terror or suspense leaves the audience feeling more confused than entertained."
What makes the special effects in this horror comedy stand out compared to other films?,"The 1998 Michael Keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it's, um, shoddy special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked up for this horror comedy they're positively mind-boggling. The killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts. Which they probably were. The cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.","The special effects in this horror comedy are so laughably bad that it detracts from the overall viewing experience. The killer snowman looks cheaply made with obvious styrofoam and oversized oven mitts for arms, making it hard to take the film seriously. The attempted parody of other movies falls flat and the overacting of the cast becomes tiresome rather than entertaining."
What are some of the main drawbacks of this movie?,"A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into Frosty the Snowman's evil twin. Then goes on a killing spree. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it is scary. If you're five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. I saw it on cable and I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie which may become a cult film. I'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm just not in it. Even though I didn't like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes I found amusing. Such as the bathtub scene and the post-explosion scene with the Picasso reference. It was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill Jack and he just doesn't seem to want to die. In short, ""Jack Frost"" is a good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget B-movie horror.","""Jack Frost"" is a movie that falls short when it comes to delivering genuine scares and is more suited for a younger audience due to its cheesy and low-budget nature. The plot, revolving around a mutated serial killer turned snowman, lacks depth and fails to elicit fear in the audience. The film's charm as a potential cult classic is overshadowed by its overall low-quality production. While there are a few mildly amusing scenes, the movie as a whole struggles to maintain interest and fails to impress as a horror film."
"What makes this movie so terrible and cringe-worthy?  
Negative","I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is pure crap! First, and this is very important, never ever watch this movie sober! Why would you? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one I feel was made intentionally bad. I just can't get over how fake the snowman is, which is why its always shown only briefly, the way it moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece of crap, becuz that was made too be a good movie, and that version is as bad as this.","The movie Jack Frost is a complete disaster from start to finish. The storyline is absurd, the acting is atrocious, and the special effects are embarrassingly fake. Watching this train wreck of a film is a truly painful experience that is only somewhat bearable if you're heavily intoxicated. Save yourself the agony and avoid this cinematic disaster at all costs."
"What makes this film enjoyable despite being considered ""stupid""?",This is the crappiest film I have ever seen but in all fairness it's watchable and rather funny. I don't think the film-makers intended it to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow (as it's the middle of winter). He then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it's own. This film is really stupid but it's funny. The killings are hilarious.I wouldn't advise you to go and buy it (like I did -the cover looked good!)but if it happens to be on TV one night and you're up for a laugh then stick it on.,
Would you recommend this movie to anyone?,"This movie, no correction, this THING, this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head. I could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try anyway. Horrible, bad, nauseating, tasteless, crap, vomit inducing, gut wrenchingly bad, hideous, nasty, putrid, there just aren't enough words in the English language! The ""plot"" involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man. Don't ask how, not important. The killer snowman runs about killing people. How, you may ask, can a snowman kill someone? In tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don't have to endure that Styrofoam snowman anymore. In ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore. Don't watch this movie! Destroy it on sight! For the sake of your very soul don't watch it!",This movie is an absolute disaster that should have never seen the light of day. The concept of a serial killer turning into a snowman is ridiculous and the execution is even worse. The film is filled with tasteless and nausea-inducing scenes that will leave you cringing. The plot is weak and the storyline lacks any semblance of logic. The snowman's methods of killing are laughable and not in a good way. Save yourself the agony and avoid this abominable mess at all costs.
What makes this movie so unappealing to watch?,"A ""friend"", clearly with no taste or class, suggested I take a look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is representative of his oeuvre, I never want to see anything else by him. It is amateurish, self-indulgent, criminally shoddy and self-indulgent rubbish. The ""whore mangler"" of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers. There is a little nudity and some erections, but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman's noose. The lighting is appalling, the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted, and the direction is clueless. I saw a doco on American exploitation filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those featured. He spoke like there was something important about his work, but after a viewing of this, I see nothing of any import whatsoever. There is no style, either, and the horrible video effects (like solarization) only enhance the amateurishness. Not even so bad it's fun. Avoid.","The movie is described as amateurish, self-indulgent, and has poor lighting and dialogue. The storyline involving the murder of prostitutes by an angry low budget filmmaker is deemed distasteful and lacking in any redeeming qualities. The overall execution is seen as clueless and lacking in style, with horrible video effects further amplifying the amateurish nature of the film. The reviewer advises avoiding this movie entirely."
"Was the film ""Return to Splatter Farm"" able to maintain its eccentricity and entertainment value throughout the movie?","Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a nut-job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.<br /><br />My Grade:F <br /><br />Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /><br />ANTI-eye candy: seeing John completely naked repeatedly","No, the film ""Return to Splatter Farm"" quickly becomes repetitive and fails to keep the audience engaged due to its erratic and nonsensical plot. The shock value wears off fast, leaving viewers feeling confused and uninterested in the overly gratuitous scenes. Furthermore, the excessive nudity and graphic content feel more like cheap tactics to compensate for the lack of substance in the film."
"Did the movie live up to the expectations with regards to writing, directing, and editing?","I was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible directing (the shot sequences do not flow) even though the director might say that that is what he is going for, it looks very uninspired and immature) the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs and the stock was low budget video. I would say that it wasn't even something as simple as mini digital video. <br /><br />There are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has, like through editing etc. But it is obvious that he just doesn't care. There is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich. It could be made better, but that would mean extra work.","The movie failed to meet expectations in terms of writing, directing, and editing. The writing was poor, the directing was uninspired and immature, and the editing seemed quite basic and low budget. It appeared that the director did not put much effort into improving the film, making it feel as lackluster as a ham sandwich."
Would you recommend this movie to anyone else?,"There are bad movies, then there are the movies that are SO bad, that they become almost art. This is one of those films. My partner and I are still both kind of shell shocked, you know, staring off into space and drooling! You can tell that the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) were having a blast, and they definitely weren't shy. I give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and REALLY bad gore effects. I laughed out loud during most of the movie, so I guess you could say that it showed me a good time. Beware viewer, the above words in no way construe that this is a good film, because it is not. All I can say in my defense, is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a GREAT title!","This movie was a complete disaster. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was terrible, and the special effects were laughably bad. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to be intentionally bad, and it just came off as cringeworthy. Save yourself the time and don't bother watching this train wreck of a film."
Was the movie able to deliver on its promise of Kira's sex scenes?,"Well, I like to be honest with all the audiences that I bought it because of Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately I did not see much of them. All sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other B movies - it just doesn't look much like two people having sex. There is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa!!! how shocking!!! Why don't we nominate this movie for Oscar Award? I can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were R-rated (Mine is imported from UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away, so yon won't end up with being a moron like me.<br /><br />Score: 2/10","The movie didn't satisfy the audience's expectation of Kira's sex scenes, which were short and poorly done, leaving much to be desired. The plot was lackluster and the overall quality was comparable to a B-movie with weird background music. The revelation of Kira's new lover being a killer was seen as unimpressive and the film was deemed to be a disappointing watch, only worthy of a low score like 2/10."
What makes this show stand out despite its flaws?,"Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made. Some of the actors are terrible. They over do it & seem fake. I can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear. It's not very well written either. I love to watch it to laugh at it. You know the saying ""It's so bad that it's good?"" Well, that saying applies to this show. I also like to watch just to see if I'm right when I guess how it's all going to end. So far I've been right every time. It's like a little game that I play. It's nice when you are bored & you feel like laughing at something.","The show is let down by its low production quality, unconvincing acting, predictable storyline, and subpar writing. One can easily foresee the outcome within the first few minutes, making it a lackluster viewing experience. The performances come off as exaggerated and artificial, failing to engage the audience. It's only entertaining in a sense that it's so bad that it becomes amusing, serving as a source of unintentional comedy for viewers looking for a good laugh."
What are the main shortcomings of this movie?,"This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me. The people must be warned!<br /><br />First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in ""zero"")<br /><br />I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis, and Christopher Walken, and yet, I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there's no script. The dialogue is unreal and plain boring, the situations are contrived, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting, and the story, although based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo.<br /><br />Never mind wasting MONEY on this movie, it's not even worth your TIME spent watching it. Please do not see it... I beg of you!","The major shortcomings of this movie include the lack of a coherent script, unrealistic and dull dialogue, contrived situations, slow pacing, uninteresting characters, and a stupid storyline. The film failed to captivate the audience and was deemed as a complete waste of time and money by many viewers."
What kind of humor did the reviewer find lacking in the movie?,"This has to be the most brutally unfunny ""comedy"" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken as a crazed homeless man CAN'T make me laugh? Something's got to be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever felt like walking out of. I used free passes, and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can wholeheartedly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed very slightly at the merry-go-round scene, and that's it. Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh, right? I don't know, I guess the filmmakers thought that ""flan"" was a funny word, or something. And the other running joke really is beating a dead horse--literally.","The reviewer found the comedy in the film to be painfully unfunny, with well-known comedians like Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken failing to deliver any laughs. They felt the movie was a complete waste of time, bordering on feeling the urge to walk out, even having used free passes. Only managing a slight chuckle at one scene, they lamented the lack of humor throughout the entire film and described it as a total disappointment."
What are negative aspects of the movie did the reviewer highlight?,"I couldn't wait to put this movie in my DVD player when I rented it. Then after I started it, I couldn't wait to get it OUT of my DVD player. Actually I watched all of the movie. My wife and I kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny ever does. The box read like the it would be really funny. The premise of the movie sound good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie miss? Well....it does miss! This is the unfunniest ""comedy"" I have ever watched. Nobody I have talked with thought it was even slightly funny. It is just a really lame movie. Trust me. Avoide it....AVOIDE IT!!","The reviewer found the movie to be extremely unfunny, despite having high expectations due to the talented cast members like Ben Stiller and Jack Black. They were disappointed by the lack of humor throughout the film and described it as a truly lame and unenjoyable comedy. The reviewer warned others to avoid watching it."
"What could have been done better in the movie ""Envy""?","How can Barry Levinson possibly assemble white-hot comedy talents Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the gorgeous Rachel Weisz, old pro Christopher Walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker?<br /><br />Stiller and Black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi-millionaire.<br /><br />The premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand, every chance they can.<br /><br />Stiller and Black are simply not funny for way too much of the time, Weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and, with the exception of Walken as a batty barfly who urges Stiller's character to take revenge, it's a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce.","The film ""Envy"" features a star-studded cast with promising comedic talents like Ben Stiller and Jack Black, yet fails to deliver any laughs. The storyline lacks substance and fails to capitalize on the potential for great humor with the cast. Stiller and Black's performances fall flat, Rachel Weisz is underutilized, and other than Christopher Walken's quirky character, the movie feels like a forced and tedious attempt at comedy."
"What major flaws are highlighted in the movie ""Envy"" according to the reviewer MERK?","Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than ""Envy"". Anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen, and was not funny the first time, a movie is in deep trouble, which ""Envy"" certainly is. A movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies, ""Flirting With Disaster"", and ""Duplex"", immediately come to mind. Be certain that ""Envy"" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, just total nonsense. ""Envy"" deserves it's low rating, because like it's subject matter, it stinks. - MERK","MERK criticizes ""Envy"" for its lackluster script and shallow characters that fail to deliver any real depth or substance. The movie heavily relies on one joke but fails to take it anywhere meaningful. The constant repetition of unfunny moments only adds to the film's overall sense of aimlessness. Even seasoned actors like Christopher Walken and Ben Stiller are unable to salvage the weak material they are given to work with. In conclusion, MERK deems ""Envy"" deserving of its poor rating due to its nonsensical narrative and overall mediocrity."
What are some reasons that this movie was not well-received by the reviewer?,"I can't say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice, but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. And I'm not one to trash a movie, but I truly believe this was awful. It wasn't even funny in the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying, too.<br /><br />Overall, well, I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken, by the way.","The reviewer found the movie to be a waste of time, not funny, and felt that it ruined the actors Jack Black and Ben Stiller for them. They also mentioned that the only enjoyable bits were the scenes with Christopher Walken and found Amy Poehler to be annoying."
"What kind of movie is ""Envy"" and what did the reviewer think of it?","I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I don't really get the point of ""Envy"". I mean, it has a dull content/topic, and it's not really funny.<br /><br />Although the acting is generally good, it's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting. Stiller and Black don't show all their talent in this movie.<br /><br />So, if you're about to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely don't go for this one. Unless you want to get bored, and I can see I'm not the only one with this opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for it (take a look at Trivia).","The reviewer didn't find ""Envy"" to be entertaining or funny, despite good acting performances. They mentioned feeling bored and suggested not choosing this movie, citing that even one of the actors apologized for being a part of it."
What makes this movie so terrible?,"this is the worst movie i've ever seen. i'm not kidding. the next time it comes on, i will just continually run my head into a wall. it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie again.<br /><br />i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again. they are both good comedians, so i was shocked this was so awkward.<br /><br />if they had to do it all over again, i'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it. the folks that fronted the money, must have lost a ton. not really- because the special effects (all 2 of them) were terrible.","This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Watching it feels like a never-ending torture. The actors, Black and Stiller, both known for their comedy, fail to deliver in this awkward and cringeworthy film. The lackluster special effects only add to the disappointment. It's better to spend time in an emergency room than to give this movie another chance."
What makes this movie so unbearable and frustrating for the audience?,"Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben stiller anymore. How this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me. I can't understand how this happens if I performed at work the way he acts in a movie I'd get fired and I own the company.....I would have to fire myself. GOD! This movie was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of POO, that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible. Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary.","This movie is a disaster from start to finish, with Ben Stiller's performance being cringe-worthy and unbearable. The plot is nonsensical, the humor falls flat, and the overall execution of the film is a complete mess. It's shocking that this film even made it to the big screen, let alone garnered any positive reviews. Avoid this movie at all costs!"
What are some major flaws in the movie 'Envy'?,"I watched 'Envy' two nights ago, on DVD, at a friends house. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but it completely fails to deliver. I watched it with about five friends and no-one laughed for the entire film. The jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny in any way... the story line is crap, and they never answer the question... WHERE DOES THE SH*T GO? Of course the answer to that is NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any sort of comedy value, and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters are developed, the plots so thin it's nearly transparent - and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny??","The comedy film 'Envy' starring Jack Black and Ben Stiller falls flat with its unfunny jokes, lackluster storyline, underdeveloped characters, and a thin, almost transparent plot. The humor completely misses the mark, leaving viewers bored and unengaged throughout the film. The overall lack of comedy value makes it a hard watch, with the only saving grace being Christopher Walken's performance."
Did this movie fail to deliver on its promise of comedy?,"i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it. in a word, it is unfunny. UNfunny. i totally believe the trivia tidbit about jack black apologizing for making this garbage. i can't believe that barry levinson didn't just toss this script when he read the first page. moreover, i can't believe that i watched more than ten minutes of it.<br /><br />i gave it 3 out of 10* because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck. also, the horse ""corky,"" by merely existing as a character in this movie, is actually quite ridiculous.","This movie was a complete letdown in terms of humor. Despite trying to watch it with a laid-back attitude, the lack of funny moments was glaring. It was so bad that even Jack Black regretted being a part of it. The fact that Barry Levinson didn't scrap the script from the get-go is baffling. Christopher Walken's involvement and a silly horse character couldn't salvage this mess. With no genuine laughs, this movie falls flat."
What did you think of the comedy film that starred Ben Stiller and Jack Black?,"I'm not sure what. I just couldn't laugh at it. I had an open mind. I didn't want to be a tight-@ss about it. But I seriously just couldn't laugh at this film. It was just not funny to me. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy. Some movies just shouldn't be made. This is one of them. Because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. Sort of at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I cannot give this anything lower than a two. And that's all I'm giving. <br /><br />2/10","This movie fails to deliver on the comedy front, as despite the talented cast, the humor feels forced and falls flat. The jokes are outdated and the overall acting comes across as silly rather than entertaining. The film's attempts at humor seem desperate and ultimately fail to impress, earning it a low rating of 2 out of 10."
"What makes this movie fall short of expectations?

Negative","I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this film. It's, in one word, boring. Maybe the fact that is too predictable, the more-than-exploited Ben Stiller's loser role or the not-at-all funny scenes make this film just something to forget. Even Christopher Walken's appearance finishes in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's acting. I loved it in most of his films, the last one I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad. About Jack Black... Well, apart from High Fidelity I've never seen him doing something good. What about School of Rock? Ooops, frightening.",I was really disappointed with this film. It was just plain boring and predictable. Ben Stiller's portrayal of a loser character felt overused and not funny at all. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken couldn't save it from feeling pathetic. I found myself wishing I could forget about this film entirely.
What aspects of the movie Envy failed to impress the audience?,"Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman the ""Dreamer"" in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray ""Vapoorize"" that when sprayed on doggie dung, makes the poo disappear into thin air. <br /><br />For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product so that I could spray it on this ""stinker"" of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well.<br /><br />Although Envy is not the worst movie that I have seen in the past 12 months (that honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it does get the honor of a close second.<br /><br />Not funny, not sad, not anything. A real ""Stinkeroo""!!!!!<br /><br />A 0.2 out of 10!!","The movie ""Envy"" falls flat with its lackluster humor and uninspiring storyline, leaving viewers unamused and unengaged. The attempt at comedy feels forced and the overall viewing experience is a disappointment. A true ""Stinkeroo"" that fails to evoke any emotions or entertainment value."
What makes this movie a film to avoid at all costs?,"Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times.<br /><br />That's it, folks. The sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not.<br /><br />These 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness (flared trousers, big hair, Zapata moustaches etc.). This one isn't.<br /><br />The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad.<br /><br />The title, hinting at a sex comedy, is grossly misleading.<br /><br />I heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague.","The film's only redeeming quality seems to be Connie Hoffman's appearance, which doesn't make up for the horrendous script, bad acting, poor direction, and inappropriate casting choices. The title is misleading and overall, this movie is a disaster that should be avoided completely."
Would you recommend this movie to a friend who enjoys action comedies?,"This movie is truly brilliant. It ducks through banality to crap at such speed you don't even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past. But it doesn't stop there! This movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy: behold as Kor the Beergutted Conan wannabe with the over-abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like there's no tomorrow (and the way he swung it, I really am amazed there *was* a tomorrow for him, or at least, for his beer gut). Don't miss this movie, it's a fantastic romp through idiocy, and sheer bloody mindedness! And once you have finished watching this one, dry the tears of joy (or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $5 to make a sequel!","This movie is a trainwreck! It tries so hard to be funny and entertaining but fails miserably. The characters are ridiculous, the plot makes no sense, and the attempts at humor fall flat. Watching this movie feels like a complete waste of time."
"What makes ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom"" a movie to avoid watching?","If somebody wants to make a really, REALLY bad movie, ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom"" really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness.<br /><br />Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a baggy white ""furry"" costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting. Work your way slowly, painfully, through more not-so-special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the heck of it).<br /><br />On second thought, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.","""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom"" sets a new standard for terribleness with its laughably bad special effects and ridiculous characters like a makeshift Chewbacca and a garden gnome tossed in for no reason. The movie fails miserably in creating a believable world, making it a painful and unbearable experience to sit through. It's best to steer clear of this disaster and find a better way to spend your time instead."
What aspects of this film might make it difficult for young audiences to enjoy?,"Think of this film as a Saturday morning live-action program from ages ago. Even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses! I can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over, but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings. And who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place? I thought this was a ""family"" movie! MST3K, here's another fine gem for your 1999 TV season!","The film's slow pace and unoriginal plotline might make it hard for the little ones to stay engaged. Additionally, the inclusion of inappropriate elements like a topless mermaid could be off-putting for a family movie."
What are the main criticisms of the movie in the review?,"There's nothing I hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid. I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. The money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you watch Project Greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can't come soon enough. Go watch a real first time effort by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits. Thank you and good day.","The critic strongly dislikes the self-congratulatory and pretentious nature of the film, claiming that it inspires unoriginal productions from privileged individuals. The writing is criticized for being obvious and lacking substance, with the critic suggesting that the budget could have been better used to support more deserving filmmakers. The film is compared unfavorably to works by other directors such as John Gulager, and the reviewer expresses a desire to move away from films made in a similar style to those by Kevin Smith and Joss Whedon."
What makes this animated short film targeted towards preteen girls unique and potentially nostalgic?,"Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life. This time the target audience is preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex.<br /><br />It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why this all leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing, becoming the comic note here, how the subject of sex is avoided. Even the word is never mentioned although ""furtilized"" will pass once. I don't really know why I saw this, but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a try.","Despite its educational value, the film lacked depth in addressing critical aspects of menstruation. The avoidance of explicit language and a more comprehensive discussion on the topic of sex left it feeling superficial and ultimately failed to provide adequate information to its target audience."
Would you recommend this movie to anyone?,"A bad one.<br /><br />Oh, my...this is one of the movies, which doesn't have even one positive effect. Just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky. I just wonder how low I.Q. you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy.<br /><br /> Is there something than this is worth watching for? Well, there is a lot of nudity involved, but it's nothing particular. And when you just think that it couldn't get worse, your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old. C'mon guys, where did you search for these actresses. In elderly home, perhaps.<br /><br /> Anyway, the leading actresses has some sex-appeal and knows how to show it. Again, too bad, that she is too skinny & old. All in all, skip these one.<br /><br />2 out of 10","Oh man, this movie was a disaster. From the acting to the storyline, everything was just terrible. The only thing worth mentioning is the nudity, but even that was nothing to write home about - the actresses looked like they were way past their prime. The leading actress tried to bring some sex appeal, but she was just too skinny and old for it to be impressive. Overall, this movie is a complete skip. 2 out of 10."
Do you think the movie successfully captures the essence of the metal culture?,"Skippy from ""Family Ties"" plays Eddie, a wussy 'metal' nerd who gets picked on. When his favorite wussy 'metal' singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. He first gets sucked into ideas of revenge, but then he doesn't want to take it as far as Sammi does. Which isn't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital. This movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say, ""Rock Star"". OK, maybe a tad more than that piece of junk, but you get my point. And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from ""Family Ties"" I haven't a clue. The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches coherency, I applaud him for that, but otherwise skip this one.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy:Elise Richards gets topless, an a topless extra at a pool party","The movie is utterly laughable and disconnected from real metal culture. The characterization of the main protagonist, played by Skippy from ""Family Ties,"" fails to resonate with the audience. The plot, centered around a deceased metal idol's spirit transferring into a record, lacks depth and fails to deliver a compelling narrative. Despite minor positives like a cameo by Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne's improved coherence, the film falls short and should be skipped."
"Why is ""Trick or Treat"" such a disappointment?","How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just don't get it. Trick or Treat managed to do it. This sucks and likes it.<br /><br />Trick or Treat is one of those movies I have to warn people about. It is a vomit-inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redeeming factors.<br /><br />For a movie about heavy metal, it sure doesn't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents. This movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986, probably one of heavy metal's strongest hours. That is quite a feat, however negative.<br /><br />Trick or Treat = so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it. That simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film.","""Trick or Treat"" manages to take the excitement of heavy metal and turn it into a lame, brainless, and gutless film. Despite boasting Ozzy Osbourne in its cast, the movie is a vomit-inducing vile atrocity that will leave you feeling worse about yourself after watching it. The film fails to capture the essence of heavy metal and instead makes it look uncool, even during heavy metal's strong era in 1986. Ultimately, ""Trick or Treat"" is so bad that you'll be angry at yourself for wasting your time on it."
Do you think the plot of this movie was believable?,"This movie has a very hard-to-swallow premise, even by this genre's standards. We are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life, but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed SPECIFICALLY at one kid, when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive, and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up. Anyway, the film is fun for a while, but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme. If they were really trying to create a new Freddy-like horror icon, they were way off: the villain here has no personality, no motivation, and no variety. (*1/2)","The movie's core premise of a record played backwards bringing a dead man to life and containing hidden messages aimed at a specific individual is too far-fetched to be believable. The attempt to create a new horror icon falls flat as the villain lacks personality, motivation, and variety."
"What was disappointing about the film ""The Hungry Bachelors Club"" according to a reviewer?","I had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience, and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post-screening survey. I felt the film's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot. Instead, it was composed of (too) many sub-plots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact any one sub-plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film. (The time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub-plots and characters.) Simply put, The Hungry Bachelors Club's plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired.","The film lacks a main plot and suffers from an overload of sub-plots, resulting in undeveloped characters and a lack of emotional connection with the audience. The director and producer failed to make viewers care about the characters, with many sub-plots feeling unnecessary and distracting from the central story."
What sets this vampire film apart from traditional vampire stories like those from Bram Stoker or Anne Rice?,"not your typical vamp story, not bram stoker or anne rice here. a truly original vampyre story. these vampyres are genetic mutants who the sunlight don't bother. they are pure evil to. <br /><br />the film is not perfect. many of the actors are clearly amateurs. the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though. the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people. also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with. i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances. no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution","While the film brings a unique twist to vampire mythology with its genetic mutant vampires, it falls short in various aspects. The acting is subpar with many amateur actors, albeit the two leads manage to deliver decent performances. The excessive violence may be unsettling for some viewers, and the film's heavy scientific explanations may come across as tedious and boring to many. The potential of the clever storyline and a few good performances is overshadowed by the film's low-budget feel and lack of widespread distribution."
What makes this movie the worst film you've ever seen?,"I don't want to go off on a rant here, but.....this is the worst ""film"" I've ever seen. Worse than The Avengers. Incompetent directing, disjointed writing, and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout. Shot on very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without the emotion. The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution, the techie elements are patently absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be funny. It's just bad. BTW, the packaging is intentionally misleading.<br /><br />Lion's Gate owes me $4.00.","Incompetent directing, disjointed writing, and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout this film. It looks like a high school project shot on very cheap video, lacking emotion. The lighting is poor, resembling a single Sun-Gun, and the sound quality, while slightly better, is still subpar with just a single mic on the camera. The plot meanders aimlessly, the techie elements are nonsensical, and the editing is extremely rough. Overall, this movie fails to even be entertainingly bad; it's just a dreadful viewing experience."
What were some aspects of the movie that made it intolerable to watch?,"I can't believe that this movie even made it to video, and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves. I literary asked for a refund. Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it, and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store. It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick. Anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union, gives the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this movie I really don't think anyone involved is a union member.","The movie lacks historical accuracy and fails to deliver any decent content, making it unworthy of even the lowest rating. The voice over and music are grating, and anyone associated with this film should be ashamed."
What are some specific aspects of the movie that stood out as particularly disappointing to you?,"This movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and got this one by accident. thought it was a joke before the actual movie. this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did. this movie had not actual facts about the real Zodiac killer. The filmmakers clearly didn't even bother to research anything on the killings... they only liked the name... so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name. I am upset i didn't realize it wasn't the movie sooner. I try to like something out of every movie, i don't hate movies... ever... except this one. If you could have given it no stars, i definitely would have. 1 out of 10.","The movie failed to deliver any scares or adhere to any real facts about the Zodiac killer, indicating a lack of research and a misleading premise."
What makes this movie so terrible according to the reviewer?,"This movie is bad. I don't just mean 'bad' as in; ""Oh the script was bad"", or; ""The acting in that scene was bad"".....I mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public. I won't even dignify it with an explanation of the (Plot??) if I can refer to it as that.I can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that I have found need to vent my spleen on a movie. I mean, after all, no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie, do they? Well, yes. Apparently they do...and the guilty man is writer/director Ulli Lommel. But the worst of it is that Blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! Be advised. Leave this crap where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, gathering dust.","The reviewer finds this movie to be an absolute disaster, expressing strong disdain towards both the writer and director. They are shocked that Blockbusters even has this film in its rental inventory and strongly advises others to steer clear and let it collect dust on the shelf."
What makes this movie a complete disaster?,"Awful, awful, awful.<br /><br />A condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make. Once again I'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap.<br /><br />I sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticism but the only one I could think of was that the opening track by Pink was pretty good....I wonder if she has seen this?<br /><br />Watch this at your peril, the boredom may kill you.","The movie is filled with condescending remarks, unpleasant autopsy photos, and is ultimately a pile of crap. The only redeeming quality is the opening track by Pink. Watch it at your own risk, as it may bore you to death."
"Did the movie live up to its potential and deliver a compelling storyline?

Negative","If I could give it a zero, I'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. Absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot, doesn't make sense of what is happening. Just PLAIN BORING. Please don't waste your money on this one. Pleaseee!!! This movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story, but nopes, I didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3-4 times than watch this crap! I don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well. Zodiac killer should be called 'Boriac killer' instead!!!","Absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot, doesn't make sense of what is happening. Just PLAIN BORING. The film fails to engage the audience and leaves them feeling disgusted rather than entertained. This movie is a waste of time and money, and viewers would be better off watching something else instead."
Do you think everyone will enjoy this movie?,"I have been learning about the Zodiac for four years now. And I'm not saying I know much more than anyone else...in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about Z, I am prolly the one with the least knowledge...But I do know or at least I think I know that most of the stuff in this wouldn't happen...From how he signed his name...to how he killed people...I thought that Godfather was the worst film ever...<br /><br />The cinematography was that of a five year old...not saying that my films are any better but I am not someone who is making movies for the mass population...<br /><br />The acting I thought for the most part was pretty good really I did...the lead didn't talk that much on camera or at all I forget and don't know because I stopped watching...his voice overs where good...<br /><br />But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else...like a large pizza or something...<br /><br />Until I learn how to write a review, Psycho Phil","The cinematography in this film was comparable to that of a five-year-old, lacking the quality expected in a movie. The storyline and portrayal of the Zodiac events did not align with known facts, which may disappoint audiences seeking accuracy. Save your money and opt for a large pizza instead, as this film may not be worth the watch."
What elements were lacking in this movie that made it unbearable to watch?,"Really, really bad. How does a film this bad get made? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some gratuitous nudity but I got nothing. I had just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was an train wreck (except for the nudity and Pancakes) but it looks like genius compared to this dreck. The best script doctor in the world couldn't have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo.<br /><br />The only thing going for this ""film"" is that it ended.<br /><br />I've got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I only paid $5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill.","This movie was a complete disaster. I was left completely disappointed with the lack of a coherent plot, engaging camera work, or any elements that could redeem it. It was a painful experience to sit through, and I found myself longing for even the smallest glimmer of creativity that never came. Overall, it was a waste of time and money, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
What makes this film a disappointment despite the clarity of the DV shots?,"I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was being generous, I know.<br /><br />This film fails on all accounts. I can not recommend this, for it is neither poetic, nor blunt. Neither dramatic, nor suspenseful. Neither controversial, nor ordinary. It is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith.<br /><br />Do not watch this, whoever you are. . .please, just stay away from this awful product.<br /><br />Thank you.","The film is an absolute letdown, lacking in poetic, dramatic, and suspenseful moments. It fails to engage the audience and is simply a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan would recommend."
What are the shortcomings of the movie being criticized?,"While William Shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in, (and I especially love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down.<br /><br />It has none of the intelligence of Millionaire, none of the flair of Deal or No Deal.<br /><br />This show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time.<br /><br />I watched it of course just to check it out. I did watch it for over 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off.<br /><br />The best part of it was William Shatner dancing on the stage. He is a hoot!!! unfortunately, this show WILL NOT MAKE IT.<br /><br />That's a given","While William Shatner's presence may bring some joy, the show is criticized for being filled with superficial elements like glitz, dancing girls, and mindless entertainment. Lacking the sophistication of other shows like Millionaire and the charm of Deal or No Deal, this movie focuses more on flashy distractions than substance. Despite Shatner's entertaining dance moves, the overall lack of depth and poor content makes it unlikely to succeed."
What makes this show stand out compared to others on television?,"My wife and I are semi amused by Howie Mandel's show.. I also like Shatner - even when he's at his most pathetic..<br /><br />But this is absolutely the worst show on television.<br /><br />Please cancel this show. It sucks a**.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than Deal or no Deal...<br /><br />The questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure. And watching Shatner or the contestant say ""Show me the money"" makes me want to vomit..<br /><br />This one will not last.","The show lacks substance and fails to engage viewers with its mixture of overly simplistic and extremely difficult questions. The constant repetition of the phrase ""Show me the money"" quickly becomes annoying, and the overall quality is deemed as the worst on television. The only redeeming quality seems to be the attractiveness of the female participants who wear revealing clothing."
What were some viewers critical of regarding the character relationships in the movie?,"As the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an RPG. You seriously thought they were gay? Are you retarded? If you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man. Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends. They weren't gay lovers like your bitching about. And to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period. Back then, women did just prepare meals while the men fought. Do you even know your history? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day? This game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it, and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story.","Some viewers were critical of the assumption that the characters were depicted as homosexual, arguing that the relationships were not accurately interpreted and demonstrated a lack of understanding of the story's context and historical setting."
What are some reasons why this movie might not be enjoyable to all viewers?,"Man, this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books. Frankly, I found it too slow and unappealing right from the start. I kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened. This movie is vastly overrated.<br /><br />Shakespeare, with the King James English, has never appealed to me, anyway, so it may just be me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello.<br /><br />The good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinematography and a young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters.<br /><br />Overall, this is simply too boring, too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again. Besides, we all know that most actors are nut-cases, anyway, but kudos to Hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story.","This movie received a lot of hype, but for me, it was a slow and unengaging experience right from the beginning. I kept waiting for the pace to pick up, but unfortunately, that never happened. The use of old-fashioned language like King James English, particularly in the portrayal of Othello by Ronald Colman, didn't appeal to me. While the cinematography and the presence of a young and attractive Shelly Winters were noteworthy, the film overall felt boring and repetitive in some scenes, making it a one-time watch at best. Additionally, the portrayal of actors as eccentric may have been realistic, but it didn't add to the entertainment value of the movie."
"What are the drawbacks of the film ""A Double Life""?","Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the backstage business is overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, ""What are ya? Some kind of nut?""). Otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny. *1/2 from ****","The witty banter in the movie feels forced, and the backstage scenes are too melodramatic. The storyline is predictable and drags on, lacking humor. Overall, the film comes off as obvious and not very engaging. *1/2 from ****"
"What makes this movie such a waste of time?
Negative","Oh man, this s-u-c-k-e-d sucked.... I couldn't even get any camp value out of this......and I sat through the whole thing on Showtime.... Don't bother waiting around for the 'naked' scenes either.....it's too late and only plastic Jenna Jameson is involved.. Shows how much discretionary cash must be laying around Hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits.. I guess Showtime had to throw something in at 1am... Next time I think I'd even rather be watching ESPN loop around every 30 minutes...","This movie was a total waste of time, lacking any redeeming qualities. The attempt at adding nudity fell flat with only plastic figures, and the overall production felt like a desperate attempt to fill airtime on Showtime. Rather than providing entertainment, it was a cringe-worthy experience that left me wishing I had chosen to watch anything else, even ESPN."
Why does the wife in the movie fail to consider her husband's safety when dealing with the psychotic stalker?,*****Warning: May contain SPOILERS********* My HUGE problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self consumed the adulteress wife is!! After having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together. He is OBVIOUSLY crazy and very dangerous. The problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to HER (and exposing her secret). Not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband! Did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic?? As soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences. Maybe there wouldn't have been a movie then but there really wasn't one anyway so what's the difference.,"The movie lacks depth in character development, especially regarding the wife's selfishness and lack of concern for her husband's safety. Her actions make it hard for the audience to sympathize with her, ultimately leading to a lackluster viewing experience."
What makes the portrayal of the helicopter unrealistic in this program?,"I really looked forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters. I don't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago. The only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960's. It hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter, which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust.<br /><br />In short, no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight. And the Bell 222, the ""actor"" that portrayed Airwolf wasn't very fast even by helicopter standards. And it didn't stay in production very long.<br /><br />There was a movie that came out during this time period called ""Blue Thunder"" that was much more realistic.","The portrayal of the helicopter in this program is criticized for being extremely unrealistic, with the helicopter depicted as achieving speeds that far exceed what is scientifically possible in real life. The reviewer also mentions that another movie from the same time period, ""Blue Thunder,"" offered a much more realistic portrayal of helicopters."
What are some reasons viewers might find the show disappointing despite their nostalgia for it?,"I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've seen. It was ultra high-tech for it's time. It could repel enemy fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air, and take down nearly anything in it's way. Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is. The casts members are hardly compelling, there are a lot of cheesy moments, and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking. And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage. Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era.<br /><br />Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider, except the crime-fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I found myself utterly bored. I do, however, love the theme music.",The show relies heavily on cheesy and fake-looking fight scenes with obvious reuse of dated Vietnam War-era footage. The cast members lack compelling performances and the plot is unoriginal compared to similar shows from the same era. This leads to a lackluster viewing experience for many.
"What are some drawbacks of the film ""Cinderella 2000""?","This film is roughly what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend but with songs and (fairly tame) sex scenes! The film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess. It's more expensive looking than most of director Al Adamson's films but it's not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci-fi films. The actors are pretty bad and unlike most Adamson films, there are no former big namers or B actors. Some of the music is OK but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.","The movie lacks a clear direction and ends up feeling like a mess. The actors' performances are subpar, and the absence of well-known actors doesn't help elevate the film. Additionally, the film fails to meet the expected budget levels for a sci-fi movie, despite looking more expensive than other films by the same director. The music is mediocre, and overall, ""Cinderella 2000"" fails to leave a lasting impression on viewers."
Was the movie '___' a worthwhile watch for viewers?,"Oh, it's the movie - I thought I waited too long to take out the dog... I can't believe I watched the whole thing. I guess I was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better. Horribly disjointed dialog, pathetic acting, and totally improbable events. Like Toby's mom hanging herself in the time it takes Col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a 24' ceiling and no chairs, counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in. The little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the puppy of the first couple was a close second. The basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick, but this version sadly is not it. I get more scared when I open my electric bill every month.","This movie felt like a never-ending attempt at horror that failed to deliver any scares or captivate the audience. The dialogues were confusing, the acting was subpar, and the events were entirely unbelievable. Even the most talented actors in the movie couldn't salvage the poorly executed storyline and direction. It left me more disappointed than frightened, and I wouldn't recommend it to fellow movie enthusiasts."
Do you trust the positive reviewer?,"The cast is OK. The script is awkward at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is. I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. I guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. Its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. The shower part...huh? What was that about? Literally, it is I have a client, ""Ok you can use our shower."" Yawn. The angles are trying way to hard. There was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are dying. In the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions.","The movie is an absolute disaster. The cast is just about tolerable, the script is a mess, and you'll find yourself more interested in doing the dishes than figuring out the point of the movie. The Shehan part is like a bad joke on the war, trying too hard to make a statement that falls completely flat. The whole film feels like a waste of time, with awkward scenes and confusing moments that make you question why you're watching it. Skip this one - it's a boring mess."
What aspects of the movie failed to live up to the expectations of someone who loved the original book?,"Not that I was really surprised....movies are never as good as the books that they originated from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books, even though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they strayed from the book's storyline too much, and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was. Ending was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery. The acting was unremarkable at best. Perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldn't have to stay so much in Lifetime's ""made for TV movie"" box, it would be a better flick. If you saw this movie I highly encourage you to track down the book and read it. I doubt you'll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.","The movie deviated significantly from the original book's storyline, failing to capture the essence of the house's horror. The ending was also altered, and Lara Flynn Boyle's appearance suffered due to bad cosmetic surgery. The acting was mediocre at best, with the movie feeling more like a TV production than a theatrical release. Reading the book is recommended over watching this disappointing adaptation."
Can you tell me about your experience watching the movie?,"I read the book a long time back and don't specifically remember the plot but do remember that I enjoyed it. Since I'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It is a Lifetime movie.<br /><br />The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses.<br /><br />The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist. Is there nothing original anymore? Sure, but not on Lifetime.<br /><br />The male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands I suppose.<br /><br />In one scene a female is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women love that but let me tell you girls something... It's not as easy as it's always made to look.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.",The movie features grade B actors and actresses with stereotypical characters that lack originality. The female cast seems straight out of a Desperate Housewives episode while the male cast comes off as fairly effeminate. The scene where a female kicks a male in the testicles for self-defense is unrealistic and the lack of originality in the storyline is disappointing.
What effect did the shaky hand-held camera work have on the viewer while watching the film?,"A shaky hand-held camera was used, presumably to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started to get motion-sickness just from watching it. It looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera (no offense meant to CP sufferers, but I don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer!) The camera work was so nauseating, and so distracting, that my wife and I considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture. I checked back a while later (it was showing on TV), and it hadn't gotten any better. I suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten!","The shaky hand-held camera work in the movie was so exaggerated that it caused motion sickness and made it nearly impossible to enjoy the film. My wife and I found it so distracting and nauseating that we had to stop watching after just 10 minutes. The constant wobbling made it seem like the cameraperson had shaky hands, which made it unpleasant to watch. It was like trying to watch a film while riding a rollercoaster, and I would recommend skipping this movie unless you want to feel queasy."
"What issues did you have with the pacing and continuity in the movie?
Negative","I found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content. My wife slept through most of it and I did not try to wake her because I felt she was not missing anything.<br /><br />When Holmes and Watson enter the house and then are potentially caught, it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly. It is also unclear how the door to the study is locked, preventing the servants from getting in.<br /><br />The thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute. I have no clue what this was supposed to represent.","The movie was slow-paced and dragged out the original story, leaving viewers feeling bored and disconnected. The lack of explanation for certain events and inconsistencies in the plot made it difficult to stay engaged. Furthermore, the confusing ending with the broken statue lacked clarity and left audiences scratching their heads."
Was this episode of Sherlock Holmes well-received by viewers?,"At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity.For a good reason! The super sleuth left his little grey cells(sorry Agatha)at home for this tale. There is no deductive reasoning,no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes. Holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot. The dastardly CAM is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner that would have made Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride-six bullets in the breadbasket.In an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of Watson's shoes.Mercifully the writer didn't decide to tack on the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film.The murderess,Holmes and Watson,escape scot free. Oh well,it is a bit of a change of pace in late Victorian London.A bit of sixgun law:-)","The episode lacks the usual deduction and intellect we expect from Sherlock Holmes. The plot seems disjointed and Holmes appears to stumble through the case rather than solving it with his usual brilliance. The ending where the villain is taken down with six bullets feels like a cheap and unoriginal cop-out. The chase scene involving a stolen shoe adds nothing significant to the story and feels like a wasted opportunity. Overall, this episode falls short of the high standards usually set by Sherlock Holmes mysteries."
"What are some shortcomings of the movie 'No, No, Nanette'?","This version is likely available at your local dollar store on DVD. The print is not great, nor is the sound, but if you have $1.00 and 90 or so minutes to spare, you'll get your money's worth (which is not saying an awful lot). Anna Neagle is extremely vapid as Nanette. Whatever her charms may have been back in the day, they are not evident in this film. A great number of fine character actors appear in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material falls remarkably short of their talents. Still, it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing. The musical numbers (there are really only two) are quite horrible. Clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original ""No, No, Nanette"". For what it's worth, the DVD can be had for $1.00. It's worth that much just to say you've seen it.","The print and sound quality are poor, the lead actress Anna Neagle is lacking in charm, the material falls short of the talented actors, and the musical numbers are quite horrible."
What were some of the major shortcomings of the movie according to a review?,"Well I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it wasn't even worth that. It seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain, I am guessing.<br /><br />Neagle - despite her glory, awards, and reputation - is a homely British gal who can't sing or dance or act.<br /><br />Some of the fine old Hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was mistaken. She was improbably popular in Britain before and after WWII. Her ""serious"" roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here.<br /><br />Only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented. Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day. At least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing!","The movie was deemed to be of poor quality, probably from a low-quality print in the public domain. The lead actress, despite her acclaim, was criticized for her lack of talent in singing, dancing, and acting. The film was described as lacking famous songs and not showcasing professional style dancing."
What makes this action movie lackluster and unimpressive?,"Don't let the name of this film deceive you, In reality Jake Speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film. When Jake Speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen, which he is often not, he's seriously relaxing. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to ""chill out"" whenever he gets the chance. Furthermore, unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you call sleeping a talent. Anyhow, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is sub par and the action, when there is some, is very lame. (The machine guns on the jeep weren't bad, but that's about it) So, if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - It has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep, but also his audience.","The film fails to deliver a captivating action hero, with Jake Speed being portrayed as lazy and unexciting. Jake's lack of heroic qualities and absence of thrilling action scenes leave the audience disappointed. The writing is mediocre, and the few action sequences are unimpressive, except for the machine guns on the jeep. Overall, the movie is a snoozefest that is unlikely to keep viewers engaged."
What elements in Jake Speed failed to deliver on the excitement promised in its promotion?,"So what's the big fuss out of making an INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor who's cast as a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who doesn't want to go out on an adventure??? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for whatever reasons possible, this movie greatly lacks in excitement! That doesn't mean it has no action, but look on the dark side of the picture. This has got to bare no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action-adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it! Besides, I've never heard of the guy, so who needs his attention?","The movie Jake Speed heavily lacks in delivering the anticipated excitement of an action-adventure thriller like Indiana Jones. The script falls flat, the action scenes are not engaging, and the film fails to deliver on the promotional hype generated around it. Additionally, the unfamiliar lead actor fails to captivate the audience, leaving viewers questioning the need for his presence in the movie."
What are the main criticisms of the movie?,"This could be a strong candidate for ""The Worst Flick Ever"". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it could be tolerated as a kid-film. However, the TRAGEDY of this entire endeavor, is that John Hurt, one of the screen's greatest actors, diminishes himself in this....I gave it two points just because Mr. Hurt SHOWED UP...I take AWAY 8 points, because he didn't run from it fast enough. As far as the rest of the cast, they are, simply, terrible. Janine Turner, as pretty as she might be, cannot act to save her soul. And the lead actor is, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad, it almost HURTS.","The main criticisms of the movie are the subpar acting of the lead actors, particularly Janine Turner and the lead actor, and the fact that even the presence of great actor John Hurt couldn't save the film. The overall quality of the cast is deemed terrible, with the lead actor being described as AWFUL. Ultimately, the reviewer suggests sparing oneself the embarrassment of watching this movie."
What did you find particularly disappointing about this movie?,"I would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasn't an option!! This movie sucks!!! The women cannot act. i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw Bobby Brown. Nobody in my house could believe i hadn't changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous. it's not just a race thing, it's also a gender. the combination of the two things is ridiculous.i am sorry because some of the people in the movie aren't bad actors/actresses but the movie itself was awful. it was not credible as a movie. it might be 'entertaining' to a certain group of people but i am not in that group. lol. and using a great line from a great, great movie...""that's all I have to say about that.""","This movie was a complete letdown, with terrible acting from the female leads and an absurd plot that failed to suspend belief. The idea of black female gunslingers in the Wild West felt forced and unrealistic, making it hard to take the film seriously. Despite some decent performances from the cast, the overall execution was so poor that even changing the channel seemed like a better option after just 15 minutes. It's a shame that potential was wasted on such a lackluster and unconvincing movie."
What detracted from your enjoyment of the movie?,"Alright, I got passed the horrible acting. I got passed the fact that Lil Kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren't moving, I got passed the weaves, I got passed the colored contacts.<br /><br />This is what killed it for me: In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up and, and then Lil Kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying, ""Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Hold up. Let's CHILL OUT here for a HOT SECOND."" I am a fan of the western movie genre, and I never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of Clint Eastwood's movies.<br /><br />If anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating, please tell me another movie that's worse than Gang of Roses.<br /><br />I'm through.","The dialogue felt out of place and unrealistic, with slang language and expressions that didn't match the genre of the movie. The acting was subpar and there were distracting errors in the scenes like static arms and unrealistic movements. Overall, the film failed to capture the essence of the western genre and left much to be desired in terms of authenticity and quality."
What could have been improved in terms of the plot and character development in this movie?,This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends. It seemed like a lackluster Set It Off meets The West. The plot barely made any sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There were too may unnecessary things going on that didn't pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along. There were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you're only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you.,"Despite the beautiful scenery and interesting concept, the movie falls flat due to its lackluster plot that barely makes sense. The abundance of characters is not well-developed, leaving viewers confused and disconnected from the story. Additionally, there are many unnecessary elements that do not contribute to the overall plot progression. The script and directing could have been better executed, leading to moments of silence and irrelevant conversations. While casting was a highlight, the film ultimately leaves viewers scratching their heads with its confusing narrative."
Was there anything salvageable about the movie?,"Must have to agree with the other reviewer. This has got to be the WORST movie, let alone western I have ever seen. Terrible acting, dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic (let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s), and oh, did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene. And the ending? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie...completely awful. And yes, it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable ""let's remember when"" shots when a main character dies. Luckily I saw this on free TV. Don't waste your time.","The movie was an absolute train wreck. The acting was cringeworthy, the dialogue felt completely out of place for a period piece, and the modern props left much to be desired in terms of authenticity. The ending was just as disappointing as the rest of the film, packed with clichés and lackluster storytelling. It's a wonder why this movie even made it to the screen. Save yourself the time and skip this one."
What were some major flaws in the movie?,"the costumes, the dialog, historical accuracy are terrible. For instance, - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The noose was accurate ( as for as I could tell), but that type of noose broke the person's neck. Ms. Dash is left hanging at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope was shot. This type of not did not strangle the person, it killed them at the end of the drop.<br /><br />And right before they go in to rob a bank (in a flashback), they pause on the street for a group hug - with their bandannas hiding their faces - that would have been obvious to people on the street.<br /><br />The poor editing - that is a battery pack under that shirt and it is obvious, the clip of the ""long ride"" shows them riding along, then reverses the film.<br /><br />I did like the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking a crap - it seemed symbolic. The entire movie was crap.","The movie had terrible costumes, dialogues, and lacked historical accuracy. The hanging scene with Stacey Dash was unrealistic as the type of noose used would have broken the person's neck, not left them hanging unharmed. Additionally, the group hug scene before a bank robbery was unrealistic and the poor editing, like a visible battery pack under a shirt, was distracting. The film also had awkward edits, like reversing a scene of a 'long ride.' Despite a symbolic moment with a horse, the overall movie was considered 'crap.'"
What made this movie an absolute disaster for the reviewer?,"An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's mind-blowing to me that this film was even made. Hip-Hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix. What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck.<br /><br />Not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock. The chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research, I actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and finally Marge Simpson.<br /><br />Simply put, I would rather stare at a blank TV than watch this movie again.","The movie was described as a ""steaming pile of cow dung"" with a confusing mix of Hip-Hop and old western themes that just didn't work. The reviewer felt that the concept and plot were laughable, the acting was atrocious, and even the presence of some decent actors made their careers a joke. They specifically called out one actress from ""Clueless"" as having her dignity stripped away by being in this film, and even listed other actors who wisely passed on the opportunity to be part of this trainwreck. In conclusion, the reviewer expressed a strong preference for staring at a blank TV screen over watching this movie again."
What unique twist does this movie bring to the western genre?,"Sistas in da hood. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s. I do not remember any westerns like this when I was growing up. What would Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil' Kim, he might say, ""Alright! I have to admit that I tuned into this just to see her. Bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick, but these are the cowgirls, and they are fine.<br /><br />Now, don't go looking for any major story here, and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting. And, when's the last time you heard John Wayne call someone, ""Dawg""? And, I don't remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the OK Corral.<br /><br />I watch this on BET, so I missed the action that got it an R rating, but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured it was Lil' Kim in that action.","The movie tries to mesh together elements of a western with modern day urban culture, but ultimately falls flat in its execution. The storyline lacks depth and substance, relying too heavily on stereotypes and cliches. The attempt to blend these two contrasting worlds feels forced and unconvincing, making it difficult for the audience to fully invest in the characters or the plot. Additionally, the dialogue and interactions between the characters come off as awkward and unrealistic, taking away from the overall viewing experience. Overall, ""Sistas in da hood"" fails to deliver a compelling narrative and struggles to find its identity within the western genre."
What could have been done differently to improve the movie?,"Hmm, Hip Hop music to a period western. Modern phrases like ""cool"" and too many others to keep track of. ""The sistahs are in tha house""!?French manicured nails on hard riding girls. Microphone packs CLEARLY visible on Li'l Kim's back. I just can't go on with the litany of errors made by the director and editors.<br /><br />The acting isn't as bad as I've ever seen. The women did well enough with a poor script.<br /><br />It was weird hearing Louis Mandylor speaking in his native accent.<br /><br />The girls are beautiful. The costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect. I just can't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story. I would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the inner city.<br /><br />","The movie is an odd mix of Hip Hop and a period western, leading to a jarring clash of styles. The modern phrases and visible microphone packs distract from the story, and the costumes, while beautiful, are historically inaccurate. The director and editors made numerous errors, impacting the overall quality of the film. Additionally, the attempt at diversity with the casting did not make up for the weak script and strange creative choices. The potential for a great story was undermined by these missteps, leaving the audience feeling disappointed and disconnected from the film."
What elements of the movie did the reviewer find particularly disappointing?,"Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, pathetic script, cheezy dialog and hip hop music & fashion...what the hell was up with that? The directer of this movie acts as bad as the movie he made. If someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing, it may of had a chance. Bet the studios are still trying figure out how they could screw up up so badly.<br /><br />The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash...the Asian chick wasn't too bad neither. These too gals carried the whole movie. If it weren't for them I would have destroyed my copy of this movie.<br /><br />If any of those who have not seen this yet and had a notion to, don't waste your time...you'll only regret it later.","The reviewer found the acting, script, dialogue, and music fashion in the movie to be subpar, with the director's performance equally lacking. The reviewer also criticized the overall quality of the film, insinuating that even the studios were perplexed by its failure."
What are some of the major flaws in the movie that contribute to it being considered the worst movie ever made?,"Wait, don't tell me... they threw out the movie and kept the out takes. You know, This movie could have been shot in a back alley in New York. The ""Gangster Bangster"" I guess. Gangster Rap, Designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head. I guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the K-Mart hats. ""Budget rent-a-horsie"", it seems, supplied the horsies. The one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words.... I though it was him talking. You know, watching this movie just confirms that, it isn't about the acting anymore... its about looks and it's about the money. Couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned. Well, all in all, I think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made. Just one more thing though, where was Ice T? Did he finally get to go on Oprah?","The movie comes across as a cheap knock-off with poorly executed scenes, lackluster performances, and questionable wardrobe choices. The storyline seems scattered, and the lack of Ice T, who was likely expected to bring some credibility to the film, is disappointing. Overall, it's clear that this movie prioritizes style over substance, resulting in a subpar viewing experience."
Was the movie populated with renowned actors who delivered commendable performances?,How is it possible that a movie this bad can be made. Bad acting. Bad script. Just an embarrassment all around. This is just one bad cliché after another.<br /><br />This movie actually has some big name stars in it. Unfortunately they're singers and not actors.<br /><br />This movie made hardly any money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there. It's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell. <br /><br />This movie actually has some big name stars in it. Unfortunately they're singers and not actors.<br /><br />This movie made hardly any money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there. It's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell.,"Not at all, the movie featured singers attempting to act, resulting in dismal performances and a lackluster script. The film failed to attract an audience due to its unappealing theme of black cowboy movies and a lack of compelling storytelling."
"What were some of the major flaws in the movie that affected its credibility and authenticity? 
Negative","To be completely honest,I haven't seen that many western films but I've seen enough to know what a good one is.This by far the worst western on the planet today.First off there black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly, no no, completely retarded!Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.Thirdly whats with the Asian chick speaking perfect English? If the setting is western,Asia isn't where your going. Finally,the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning.Now don't get me wrong I'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie,this movie is the worst presentation of black people I have ever seen!","The movie lacked historical accuracy with its portrayal of black people, women, and Asian characters in the Wild West. The inclusion of unrealistic elements like a gun-toting black woman and an Asian character speaking perfect English took away from the overall integrity of the film. Additionally, the depiction of an evil gay character felt forced and unnecessary. The movie's attempt to be edgy and different ended up coming across as inauthentic and poorly executed."
Was the diverse representation and language usage in the movie historically accurate?,"Some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period. Get a grip and read a book. There were quite a few Asians (Chinese), there were quite a few blacks (freedmen) and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns; it is the second amendment you know. And as far as the use of modern language goes, none of those Westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted. Americans had different accents, used different inflections, spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Don't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just didn't dig it. Be honest. Maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you're seeing.","Some people have criticized the movie for its lack of historical accuracy, particularly the inclusion of black people, Asians, and women with guns in the Old West. They argue that these elements were not plausible for that time period."
What are some criticisms of the movie?,Mario Van Peebles pops up for less than a five second cameo. Glenn Plummer shows up a little longer but its a ladies show all the way. Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye have been in better projects. Bobby Brown leers and mugs through his little time on screen. This is how it was pitched...Five tough women shootin' and lovin' in the Wild Wild West. Four black and one Asian. Oh and Lil' Kim is a tough talking' heartbreaker and Marie Matiko can bring in the pacific rim market. We can shoot it for less than 15 million. Straight to video and we'll double but more likely triple our dollars.<br /><br />Greenlight that puppy.<br /><br />You got it boss.,"The movie lacks depth in characters and relies too heavily on stereotypes, offering little substance beyond the flashy premise. The inclusion of stereotypes like the tough-talking heartbreaker played by Lil' Kim and the focus on race and gender diversity seems forced and contrived. The performances from the cast, including Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye, come off as lackluster and uninspired. Overall, the film feels more like a rushed, low-budget project aimed at making a quick profit rather than delivering a compelling story."
What are the main issues with the film?,"This really doesn't do the blues justice. It starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (?) and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians. Corny as it is, this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary. Afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes, filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland raping the same songs afterwards. This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so great, but it doesn't make for compelling viewing. There is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play. Nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.","The film fails to do justice to the blues genre, with poorly executed reenactments and a confusing mix of modern and classic elements. The overreliance on visual effects and unconvincing performances make it hard to engage with the film, ultimately leaving viewers disappointed and disconnected from the subject matter. This mismatch between style and substance makes it a forgettable and frustrating viewing experience."
"What are some drawbacks of the film ""The Blues"" directed by Wim Wenders?","This film is deeply disappointing. Not only that Wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid. Yawn. I had expected more of him.","The film lacks a diverse musical representation of Blues and focuses too much on Wenders's personal interests, making it uninteresting to watch. The only enjoyable part is the interview of a Swedish couple, while the overall theme is portrayed in a dull and uninspiring manner, failing to captivate the audience."
What were some major issues that plagued this film according to a viewer's negative review?,"Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended I'm sure.<br /><br />It was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would-be viewers are morons OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both.... Thank God for fast forward! I can't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit barely, and a script that cries for a total rewrite,.... I just can't say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films, this would be a good effort.<br /><br />If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid crap like this.","The viewer criticized the film for being horribly directed, with a script in desperate need of a rewrite. They mentioned that the actors failed to deliver a compelling performance, and the overall production was insulting to the intelligence of the audience. The viewer recommended avoiding such low-quality content and seeking out better entertainment options."
What made you feel disappointed after watching the movie?,"I was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was I p.o'd!!! it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b/c I didn't want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it. I thought that all my stress would pay off by the time I got home to and watching the movie b/c the review I read said the movie was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck! b/c it's not until then the movie turn's into a horror. don't bother with this one folks, your better off watching ""dankness falls""","The movie took forever to actually become interesting, with the plot dragging on for the first hour. It was definitely not the pleasant surprise it was hyped up to be, leaving me regretting the time and money I wasted on it. Stick to ""dankness falls"" instead."
What were some of the criticisms about the child actors and protagonist in the movie?,"...the child actors were annoying. Also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, though. If not for the death scenes, this movie would have a very Disneyish feel to it.<br /><br />The main child protagonist didn't seem nearly as scared as she should have been. If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual, you can bet your arse I wouldn't be out wandering around and riding my bike.<br /><br />Overall, I've seen worse (i.e. It Waits) but it's nothing I would watch again, or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you're an avid horror collector.","The child actors were annoying and the main child protagonist didn't exhibit the appropriate level of fear when faced with danger, making their performances lack authenticity. Additionally, the film seemed to struggle to maintain viewer engagement throughout its 90-minute runtime, with some viewers feeling it could have been condensed. The movie also risked feeling too Disney-like if not for the decent death scenes included."
What are some reasons why the film received negative feedback?,"I tried to finish this film three times, but it's god awful. Case in point: mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast,mom stops for gas, crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the B&B try to rape her. She escapes, heads to B&B and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops, story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts. Wow.<br /><br />Other action logic deficits abound. Acting is also lukewarm, and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny, badly acted moment.<br /><br />Moments of intense gore/death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time-filler interplay between characters.<br /><br />Less focus on gore, more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated.","The film is filled with illogical actions and lackluster performances, making it difficult to engage with the story. Moments of intense gore feel out of place amidst poorly acted scenes and questionable character decisions. The focus on graphic violence overshadows any attempts at creating a compelling narrative or atmosphere."
What makes The Tooth Fairy stand out from other horror movies?,"The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives. The first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day. The worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect. The eye candy is pretty good for both genders. Camera work is good. Dialog is fair but cheesy. I expected the film to be a bare bones, low budget, slasher with very few redeeming factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.","The Tooth Fairy's storyline is predictable and lacks originality. The shift between past and present is confusing and disrupts the flow of the movie. The characters are one-dimensional and fail to evoke any genuine emotion from the audience. The scares are more reliant on gore rather than building actual tension or suspense. Overall, the film falls short in delivering a truly engaging horror experience."
What are some critique about the characters and plot in this movie?,"Where to begin. This movie started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of ""Darkness Falls"". An old , disfigured woman living in the woods, giving kids presents for their teeth. Sound familiar? Then it changes. In ""Darkness Falls"", the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and their sister? I think the movie would've been fine without them. It seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill. Although, it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble-head for a change. Okay to rent, but I wouldn't suggest buying it.","The additional characters like the rocker, hippie girlfriend, and the Bubbas seemed unnecessary and only served as targets for the tooth fairy to kill. It felt like the producers added these characters just for the sake of increasing the body count, making the movie feel forced and lacking in substance. The plot resembled ""Darkness Falls"" too closely in the beginning, failing to bring anything fresh or original to the table. It's an okay rental at best, but not worth buying."
What are some aspects of the movie that disappointed you?,"i was enjoying this movie most of the time, but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children's movie. i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. it was a big let down. there's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like ""babe"" (the pig) or ""angels in the outfield"" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when i bought this movie, i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but they don't. they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls.","The movie felt like it was trying to cater to both children and adults, resulting in a disjointed experience. The addition of blood, nudity, and language felt out of place and unnecessary. The film failed to deliver on its potential to be a better alternative to a similar movie and ended up being worse."
What did you dislike about the movie overall?,"This movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to watch ""Darkness falls"" actually and thought that this was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I fast-forwarded as much as I could and still I couldn't get rid of the boring moments. I just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie. They were actually given money for this crap. Isn't that amazing? I mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood-grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such crap movies? Oh, and the ""tooth-fairy"" was lame. Not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make-up.","The movie was incredibly stupid and it felt ridiculous. The story was boring, the characters were poorly developed, and the scary moments fell flat. The violence was over-the-top and unrealistic, making it hard to take the movie seriously. Additionally, the tooth fairy character was unconvincing and failed to evoke any genuine fear. Overall, the film was a major letdown and a waste of time."
How does this new Scooby-Doo show compare to the original concept and animation style?,"The first episode of this new show was on today, and it was horrible. Not only did Shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture, but it's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it's barely recognizable as a 'Scooby-Doo' show.<br /><br />Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there, the team still solved mysteries. This new show instead features Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion. There's not even a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did NOT put my mind at ease). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make THIS? <br /><br />The show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole Scooby Doo gang, all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggy, and even then I'm being far too generous.","The first episode of this new show was a major disappointment. From Shaggy's high-pitched voice that was painful to listen to, to the complete deviation from the traditional Scooby-Doo storyline, this new version missed the mark. The absence of classic elements like the Mystery Machine and the focus on a James Bond-like super-villain felt out of place and unappealing. Overall, this new show failed to capture the charm and essence of the original Scooby-Doo series."
"What are some aspects of the show ""Get a Clue"" that deviate from the classic Scooby-Doo formula?","I grew up with scooby(kinda the re-runs of where are you)I hate scrappy, love Daphne, and feel its not complete with out the whole gang. But this is sad, scooby doo is mystery solving comedy-not bad totally spy's jap anime. i like ""whats new"", they had to give danger-prone Daphne a makeover sometime :( and try to lose the *sex *drug jokes of many a generation, but this ""get a clue"" is flat out crap and should not have the Scooby name attached. They even tried to do some lame punk thing with the theme song. now i'm gonna go watch my DVD of scooby doo where are you to wash the filth of this new series off my eyes","While growing up with the original Scooby-Doo series, a fan feels that ""Get a Clue"" strays too far from the mystery-solving comedy vibe, resembling a Japanese anime more than the familiar show. The makeover given to the character Daphne, removing the essence of the whole gang, and incorporating unappealing themes like sex and drug references, left the viewer disappointed. The attempt at a punk-themed theme song was considered lame, ultimately resulting in a series deemed as flat-out crap not deserving of the Scooby-Doo name."
"What issues did viewers have with the movie ""Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue""?","Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue. It's like watching a much-loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness!! Clearly the work of people with no soul, no love or respect for the original work. What in the name of all that's holy were they thinking of? It seems they were trying to go all post-modern and ironic. Instead it's just abysmal swill!! What's the point in taking up a successful franchise like 'Scooby-Doo' if you just going to flush it down the toilet? My son loves the original series - and even some of the spin-off movies - but he can't stand this drivel! And let's face it, you can't argue against the tastes of a seven year-old","The movie was criticized for completely missing the mark on capturing the essence and charm of the original ""Scooby-Doo"" franchise. Many viewers felt that the attempt to make the film post-modern and ironic resulted in a disappointing and nonsensical storyline. Additionally, fans of the original series and spin-off movies found this adaptation to be subpar, with some describing it as abysmal swill that lacked the heart and soul of the beloved cartoon."
"What are your thoughts on the show ""Shaggy and Scooby get a clue""?","I have grown up with Scooby doo all my life, My dad grew up with scooby doo. We have just watched the first episode of the travesty that calls itself Shaggy and Scooby get a clue. What planet are Warner Bros on allowing this shambles to air. The characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousins (who are Scooby Doo fans too). Scooby and Shaggy just aren't!!!!! if anyone but Casey Kasem does the voice of Shaggy it just isn't gonna work folks!!!! trust me.<br /><br />This program was disgraceful. What's New Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format. Bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true Scooby","The show was a complete disgrace, the characters were poorly drawn, the story was poorly written, and the voices of Scooby and Shaggy didn't do justice to the original characters. It's a disappointing deviation from the beloved classic ""Scooby Doo""."
Was the movie able to maintain the initial intrigue and interest throughout its duration?,"What a let down! This started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail, but I was nevertheless gripped and kept watching.<br /><br />David Morrissey is always good value and he Suranne Jones were good leads. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalised with possible terrorist connections.<br /><br />But then Morrissey's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was dull, dull, dull. The whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the dénouement was unbelievably feeble.<br /><br />Five hours of my life for that? My advice: watch paint dry instead.","The movie started off promising with an engaging mystery and intriguing characters, despite its slow pace. The actors like David Morrissey and Suranne Jones delivered solid performances, and the exploration of Muslim aspects added depth. However, the disappointment came when Morrissey's character was abruptly killed off, leading to a lackluster final episode and an unsatisfying conclusion. After investing five hours into the movie, the payoff was underwhelming and left much to be desired. It fell short of expectations, ultimately resulting in a dull and unfulfilling viewing experience."
Was the dialogue in the movie easily understandable?,"I cannot believe that I wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish. The previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible? As a result I suppose I lost track of what was going on, and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them-and-us thing between Muslims and the rest I soon lost interest. The ending was a complete anti-climax. A complete dud.","No, the dialogue in the movie was mostly incomprehensible, with Suranne Jones' mumbling and gabbling making it difficult to follow along. This lack of clarity in the dialogue led to a loss of interest in the plot and a feeling of disappointment towards the anticlimactic ending."
What impact can Bollywood movies have on viewers on both sides of the border?,"Come on! Get over with the Pakistan bashing guys. Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers.<br /><br />I am a HUGE Bollywood fan- but anti-Pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay, cinematography, action sequences- everything.<br /><br />I'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its Bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say: give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses.","The constant focus on anti-Pakistan themes in some Bollywood movies can detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, making it hard to appreciate the screenplay, cinematography, and action sequences. The heavy emphasis on these themes can come across as propaganda rather than quality filmmaking, leading to a sense of discomfort for viewers like me who are looking for more nuanced storytelling. It's important for Bollywood to move away from these narratives and focus on promoting messages of peace and unity instead."
What caused the downfall of the movie after the first half hour?,"The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. However, once the action switched to the home of Ingrid's fiancé, it all completely fell apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film. The fiancé's boorish son and the military attaché's vying for the maid's attention looked stupid--sort of like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate (just as in the other film). I was not a huge fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film.","The movie started off strong with a charming romance between the main characters, but everything went downhill once the setting changed to the fiancé's home. The introduction of poorly developed side characters and a lackluster storyline reminiscent of a cheesy TV show ruined the film's initial charm and elegance."
What glaring mistake was made in the movie and what aspects of the film contributed to it being deemed as overall pretty awful?,"Spoiler warning.<br /><br />When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her, to make it appear that she's been drinking. But right before she is killed, tells her sister's business partner (Teri Garr) on the phone that she hasn't had a drink in 4 days. Yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report! And, the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs. Huh? Really bad mistake in this movie, which is pretty awful, overall. <br /><br />Surprisingly bad, considering the great cast. Some faults: the writing isn't very good, the music is made-for-TV bad, and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie.","The movie makes a major error in not addressing the inconsistency about the main character's supposed drinking habit, leading to a lack of credibility in the storyline. Additionally, the writing is weak, the music is subpar, and the lack of suspense due to the early reveal of the mystery makes the movie a disappointing watch overall."
"What are some major drawbacks of the movie ""Chinese Ghost Story III""?","Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films. The film delivers the spell-casting special effects that one can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. The actors all play extremely silly caricatures. You have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla films, including shabby larger-than-life special effects and a (well, yet another) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have grinned if I was expecting camp.<br /><br />It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula. They won't be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo.","Chinese Ghost Story III is a disappointment compared to its predecessors. The movie falls short in terms of character development, humor, and plot originality. The actors' performances come off as exaggerated and unconvincing, making it hard to connect with the story. The predictable storyline and slow pacing further contribute to the overall lackluster experience. Additionally, the special effects, which are a highlight of the film, start to look cheap and reminiscent of outdated monster movies towards the end, diminishing the overall viewing pleasure."
"Can you share your thoughts on the movie ""The Space Adventures""?","I went to see this one with much expectation. Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic to character's behaviors. Today's kids need creative stories which would inspire them, which would make them 'daydream' about the events. That's precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers?) Seriously don't waste your time & money on this one.","I was really disappointed with this movie. The dialogue felt incredibly silly, and the whole storyline lacked any sense. Even a child would notice the illogical actions of the characters. Kids nowadays need movies that can spark their imagination and make them dream about extraordinary things, just like how movies like E.T. and Star Wars did in the past. Save your time and money, and skip this one."
What aspects of the movie's plot were unrealistic and could have been improved?,"About the baby: Why wasn't big brother assuming he'd be hungry for a bottle or some nourishment or a diaper change? He should have been screaming non-stop after that many hours without care. Definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place when he didn't need to.<br /><br />And why was the road miraculously clear whenever anyone wanted to drive somewhere? Didn't any uprooted trees fall on the roads and block them?<br /><br />I can't imagine the cops at the roadblock not immediately following after any young person who would crash it, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there.<br /><br />That being said, it was nice to have a movie children could safely watch, for a change.","The lack of realistic reactions from the characters, particularly the big brother's negligence towards the baby's needs, the miraculously clear roads without any obstacles, and the unrealistic behavior of the cops at the roadblock, detracted from the film's credibility. These unrealistic elements overshadowed the positive aspect of providing a safe viewing experience for children."
"What were some of the shortcomings of the movie ""Night of the Twisters""?","I am not saying that Night of the Twisters was horrible, but it was far from great. Mediocre at absolute best. I seems though that every time one type of movie is released, a second must be around the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Night of the Twisters is really just Twister except worse and with mundane special effects.<br /><br />I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if they weren't great, it was the movie itself, the directing, the special effects, the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage.<br /><br />I really don't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other, but this one would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.","The movie ""Night of the Twisters"" failed to impress due to its lackluster special effects, unoriginal storyline, and a general feeling of being a poorer version of the movie ""Twister"". The plot about a town being struck by tornadoes felt odd and confusing, and even though the actors did their best, the overall production fell short of being engaging. The movie failed to distinguish itself in a genre already saturated with similar disaster films, making it forgettable and uninspiring."
What made the movie so unbearable for the viewer?,"It's hard to believe people actually LIKE this dreck! I do think kids can enjoy it, but to me it's the kind of kid film parents can't bear to sit through. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst kid actor of all time. I will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid, but she was truly painful to watch. I feel embarrassed for her now, having people know it was her. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn the sound off--then I came here and discovered they did that because she won Star Search. I've always felt Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful, sadly missed brother, and this crap shows why. Zero stars.","The movie's predictable plot, unimpressive performance by Belushi, and possibly the worst kid actor of all time made it difficult to sit through. The young actor's painful performance, especially during the singing of the Star Spangled Banner, was embarrassing to watch. The film did not meet the viewer's expectations and failed to deliver an enjoyable experience."
What are some of the major flaws that make this movie a painful watch?,"Bottom of the barrel, unimaginative, and practically unwatchable remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot as the Filipino film STRYKER and is worse by far! Bad acting, dialog, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences... The list goes on and on. Italy made literally dozens of Road Warrior rip-offs in the early 80's, some good, some bad. This is the worst by far, no contest. Not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable, the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half. There was 1 (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie, and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding. But EVERYTHING else about this movie seriously reeks! For actual post-nuke fun, go track down a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX instead. They're much more enjoyable than this rubbish.","The film is a complete copy of another film without adding anything original, it suffers from bad acting, dialogue, effects, dubbing, pacing, and action sequences. The overall mood of the film is bleak and miserable, making it a boring and tedious experience to sit through. The only redeeming qualities are a single chase sequence and one cool shot with a hand grenade exploding, but everything else in the movie is just awful. It is advisable to watch other post-apocalyptic films like ENDGAME, AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX for a more enjoyable experience."
What makes this movie unlikely to capture the attention of those not interested in the game of bridge?,"This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in ""Glen or Glenda?""<br /><br />The subject: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set plays it; the Bohemians play it. The Russians -- who speak very questionable ""Russian"" and have most unconvincing accents when they speak English -- play it at the restaurant where they work.<br /><br />If one isn't interested in bridge, one -- even despite the great cast -- isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.<br /><br />Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.","The movie's bizarre theme of playing bridge may not appeal to a wide audience, with an unlikely storyline and questionable accents that detract from the performances of the talented cast. The fetishistic script ultimately sinks the potential of the film."
What makes this movie fall short despite a few positive aspects?,"I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early movies: her acting back then was light and breezy, and she sure knew how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by Glenda Farrell. Young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer-husband (Paul Lukas) into becoming a championship bridge player. It's not the most cinematic of games, and the long, talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film.<br /><br />There's one interesting bit though. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of quick shots show airplanes, trains, football games, even a diver in mid-air, freezing in anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of a freeze frame I've seen in an American film. Wish the rest of it were that inventive-and funny.","While Loretta Young's performance and the supporting turn by Glenda Farrell offer some entertainment value, the overall storyline of a hatcheck girl convincing her husband to become a championship bridge player lacks excitement and fails to engage the audience. The long, talky middle part focused on their marriage falling apart drags the film down, and the lack of cinematic appeal in showcasing bridge playing is evident. Despite a briefly inventive freeze frame scene towards the end, the film overall lacks inventiveness and humor, making it a disappointing watch."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find disappointing?,"Having read another review, I thought this movie would actually be good. I do enjoy the ""B"" movies, but this couldn't even be classed as such. The photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie. But the editing left much to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. The music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. If the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in porn flicks. If you want to see a ""B"" vampire movie, check out 'Blood Ties'. You'll be much more entertained.","The movie failed to live up to the reviewer's expectations, particularly in terms of editing, music, sound, and acting. The editing was choppy, the music was described as awful, and the sound choices were not well-received. The acting was also criticized, with the reviewer comparing it unfavorably to that of porn films. The only redeeming quality mentioned was the photography, but overall, the movie fell short in many aspects."
"What is the premise of the movie ""To Die For"" (1989)?",To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties. The only thing notable about this feature was the last movie Duane Jones appeared in. Other than that there's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film. A tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of L.A. looking for it. Will he succeed or will Vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century?<br /><br />This movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed. They're so bad they make this one look like a classic. I know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting.<br /><br />Not recommended by me because I didn't like it.<br /><br />'nuff said?,"""To Die For"" (1989) was just another cheap direct-to-video feature that was overplayed on cable during the early nineties. The only noteworthy aspect was it being Duane Jones' final film. Apart from that, it offers nothing compelling, unless you're into poorly disguised chick flicks pretending to be horror movies. The storyline follows a weary vampire seeking love in the streets of L.A. with lackluster results. The film lacks proper lighting, and the subsequent sequels are even worse, making the original seem like a masterpiece. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film as I personally did not enjoy it."
What are some major flaws in the movie that contribute to its lackluster reception?,"I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both O'Toole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. I've a feeling O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (York). He is also barking mad. But apart from that, your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. Risible.","The movie with a cast led by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York ended up being a disappointing and confusing mess. The storyline was obscure, the acting was overdone, and the overall feel was pretentious and unwatchable. It seemed like even the talented cast and director were unable to salvage this film from being a dull and forgettable experience."
What aspects of the movie do you feel highlight the lack of originality and the poor performances of the actors?,"I do not believe all the praise for this movie. The play and movie were a ripoff of Sleuth. Michael Caine wishes he were Olivier, and Reeves wishes he were Caine. Caine even had the nerve to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part. Jude Law? You mean the one that did the remake of ""Alfie""? <br /><br />This movie was made during a period of Caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would star in such award winning movies such as this, and ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"". What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is Reeves death. He deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in the $5.97 bin at Walmart. Along with gems like ""The Island"", and ""Blame it on Rio"".","The movie was criticized for its lack of originality, with comparisons to other films like Sleuth being drawn. The performances of Michael Caine and Keanu Reeves were deemed subpar and lacking in comparison to more accomplished actors. The overall quality of the movie was called into question, with suggestions that it was only made to help Caine pay off debts and that it belonged in discount store bargain bins."
Why did the first episode of Robin Hood receive such negative feedback?,"I can clearly see now why Robin Hood flopped quickly. The first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing BBC has aired. The opening scenes were about as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword fight was just laughable. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging some cow clad in make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody. The series may have improved drastically since then, but this first episode quickly put people's hopes down, and is essentially a pile of cr*p. A great hero of England has been disgraced.<br /><br />""Will You Tolerate This?"" I won't, that's for sure, unless the BBC start to understand what is a wise investment. 3/10","The first episode of Robin Hood was described as intense, lacking in meaningful content, and having unintelligent scenes. The character of Robin Hood was criticized, and the sword fight was deemed laughable. The episode was seen as a disappointment and a poor representation of a beloved English hero."
What aspects of the movie could have been improved to make it more enjoyable for viewers?,"Let me confess. I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. Besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of ""invisible-man"" genre special effects (highly visible strings and other such paraphernalia), the script wasted no chance -- in fact it went out of its way -- in insulting all non-WASP races and real-or-imagined homosexuals. Every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. It starts to grate on your nerves, along with the shaky sound, candid- camera style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat of a surprise. But by the time you get there, you hardly care less. Too bad, it could been a reasonably good movie.","The movie was a disappointment, despite potential, as it heavily relied on outdated and offensive stereotypes. The special effects were poorly executed, the script was filled with unnecessary insults towards marginalized communities, and the overall execution fell short with shaky sound and subpar cinematography. By the end, the disappointing elements overshadowed any potential the film had to be decent."
"What makes the 3-D effects in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" subpar?","The 3-D featured in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy features lousy 3-D effects that makes the 3-D effects in ""Jaws 3"", ""Amityville 3"", and ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" look better by comparison. Not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme. This was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got trapped in this mess, but at least it didn't kill their careers. Tambor would go on to star on HBO's ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and Ron Howard's box office smash ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", while Guttenberg followed this flop with ""Police Academy"" and ""Cocoon"". What them in those projects instead of them here in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". If you do, you'll regret it.<br /><br />1/2* (out of four)","The 3-D in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is absolutely terrible, it's being described as dumb, lousy, and asinine. The reviewer emphasizes that the 3-D effects in this movie pale in comparison to even older films like ""Jaws 3"", ""Amityville 3"", and ""Friday the 13th Part 3"". The poor quality of the 3-D effects and overall silliness of the film are highlighted, with a strong suggestion to avoid watching it at all costs."
"What went wrong with the sequel to the classic Disney film ""Cinderella""?","I'll just put it out here, that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen. In 1950, Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take away the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. ""Put it together and what do you get?"" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After i saw this, I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should've ended with, ""and they lived happily ever after."" not this garbage. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like ""A twist in time"" which was moderate but better than this. Also, What do we care of Anastasia? She switched sides like Iago did, but it didn't help anyone.","The sequel to Cinderella was a major disappointment, lacking the charm and magic of the original. The plot was weak, like something out of a forgotten TV show, and the addition of new characters like Anastasia fell flat. It felt like a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of the original film, leaving audiences wishing they had stuck with the classic ""happily ever after"" ending instead."
"Why would anyone waste their time making a sequel to a classic fairytale like Cinderella? What's the point of ruining a perfectly wrapped up ""happily ever after"" ending just to drag out the story and potentially mess up everything we loved about the original? It's like trying to fix something that was never broken in the first place.","I've got a question for those who thought of this idea. Why? What made them think to make a second movie of this. If memory serves, didn't Cinderella end with ""They all lived happily ever after""? I'm pretty sure it did, or it was implied. Wait a minute, if they all lived happily ever after, how could there be a sequel? Unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history, there couldn't be a sequel. I mean sure, they could have Cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie that ends in ""happily ever after"" can not have a sequel; if it does then they don't live happily ever after! Something's got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending! Why? That's not right, it's evil. That's my final word on the matter.","Question: Why would anyone waste their time making a sequel to a classic fairytale like Cinderella?

What are some reasons that might make Cinderella II a disappointing movie?,"I've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen, (followed by Peter Pan 2, and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these movies are made with the same idea; because the movie has no plot, they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids don't care how good the original movie was, they just care that the movie is entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that doesn't mean it's horrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.","Cinderella II is filled with jokes to compensate for the lack of a strong plot, making it a mediocre sequel that leans heavily on humor rather than substance. The movie lacks the charm and magic of the original, resulting in a forgettable and unimpressive viewing experience."
What are some common criticisms of the movie?,"If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I can't stand it!! I'm all up for sequels....when they have a decent storyline. But this is nowhere near up to standard. Please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid's film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />I've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.","The movie is mainly enjoyable for kids under six or seven, but falls short for adult viewers due to a lack of decent storyline. The constant repetition and lack of depth make it a tedious watch for parents."
What are some specific aspects of the movie that disappointed you as a fan of the first one?,"I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This movie down right sucked! It lacked the magic of the first. You could actually understand every word the mice said, the animation is crappy, the palace is much much different from the first movie, there's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible, luckily the Prince didn't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid. Basically its like The Lion King 1 1/2 except its different stories all told by the mice. The reason I'm giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable.","The movie lacked the magic of the original, with subpar animation, unappealing new characters, and a significant departure from the first movie's setting and vibe. The storyline felt disconnected and unoriginal, similar to a collection of different stories told by the mice. The only redeeming quality was the songs not sung by characters."
What aspects of the movie did not resonate well with the audience?,Quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen. When has Hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked Republicans? Why don't they learn. The Dixie chicks haven't. These Lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves; oblivious to the fact that most of America is much further right than they are.<br /><br />The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all.<br /><br />Dan Akroyd's imitation of Cheney was bad.<br /><br />I would have thought Cussack could have landed better movies.<br /><br />It wasn't funny.,This film was criticized for its portrayal of Republican figures and its lack of humor. Many viewers felt that the imitation of Cheney by Dan Akroyd was subpar and John Cusack's performance did not live up to expectations. The film was deemed unfunny and was seen as a failed attempt at political commentary.
Was this movie a complete disappointment?,"Just utter trash. I'm a huge fan of the Cusacks, this being the sole reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the reprise, in complete and depth less quality, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from that, the films' role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose. And to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps. Imitation is, apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as though this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meet the (watch if your a moron) Spartans in terms of political satire, lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves.","The movie was nothing more than a lame attempt at political satire, failing to offer any substance or originality. The Cusacks' performances felt like recycled versions of their previous roles, adding nothing new to the film. The attempt to be satirical fell flat, coming across as overly obvious and lacking any cleverness. Overall, this movie is a forgettable mess that deserves to be ignored and left to fade into obscurity."
What is the overall quality of the movie?,"With this cast and budget you will expect more.<br /><br />John Cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange, yet still work. Neither he, his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage.<br /><br />The movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that. The plot goes nowhere, the writing is contrived, senseless and the characters paper thin. If you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery, this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey.<br /><br />Dan Akroyd's appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie, 1991's Nothing but Trouble. Frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired.","The movie is a complete disappointment despite having a talented cast and a decent budget. The plot is weak, the writing is poor, the characters lack depth, and the humor falls flat with contrived sight gags. The movie is a career killer and reminiscent of other truly awful films."
Can you elaborate on what didn't work for you in this film?,"This film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end.<br /><br />Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.<br /><br />There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.","The film attempted to juggle multiple genres but unfortunately failed in all of them. It lacked a coherent critique on the serious issue of corporatization of war, instead opting for clumsy and trivial humor. The attempts at satire fell flat, resulting in a movie that missed the mark and failed to deliver a meaningful message."
What were some of the reasons the reviewer did not enjoy the movie?,"I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this film was touted) but this one failed me miserably. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I rapidly lost interest. I feel so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved with this movie. I'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one. The one thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played Yonica's character so well that I didn't even recognize Hillary; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her. Luckily I rented it for $1 through Red Box; had I paid to see it in on the big screen, I would be really fuming!!","The reviewer found the plot confusing which made it hard to stay interested in the film. They expressed feeling sorry for the well-known actors in the movie and mentioned if they had paid to see it in theaters, they would've been really upset."
What are the major shortcomings of this particular film adaptation of the BDWY musical?,"In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.)But to me that's all there is. Most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when it's played by George Wendt who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar stool in Boston. Jason Alexander is passable, but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the stage script now, but I hope the young out there, who have never seen a musical, DON'T judge them all by this.","Despite some standout performances by Tyne Daly and Vanessa Williams, this version falls short due to lackluster performances from most of the cast. Chynna Phillips and George Wendt fail to fully embody their characters, and Jason Alexander's unconvincing wig detracts from his performance. The overall quality of the production is underwhelming, with subpar dancing and a feeling that many actors are simply going through the motions. Viewer beware, this adaptation may not do justice to the original musical."
What were some common criticisms of the movie remake?,"Needless remake, and it can't come close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and mostly it lacks talent, not just with the acting, but the direction, sets, costumes etc. are all below par. It has a blatant disregard for period detail. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member that shows any flair, Tyne Daly isn't too bad. They should have left well enough alone. The singing ranges good (Vanessa Williams) to poor (everyone else). Watch the original 1963 version and skip this one. There is not much here to recommend.","The remake failed to capture the charm of the original movie. The extreme length of the film led to yawn-inducing parts. Critics noted the film's excessive political correctness and a lack of talent in various aspects such as acting, directing, sets, and costumes. Additionally, the movie showed a blatant disregard for period detail, and only a few cast members, specifically Vanessa Williams and Tyne Daly, were praised for their performances. Overall, the remake was deemed unnecessary, and viewers were advised to watch the original 1963 version instead."
What are the standout performances in the movie?,"Why? Because for one reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than Ann Margret singing ""Bye Bye Birdie"" at the opening. She reprises it again at the ending, too (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if that's all of it that you watch. You'll agree, I'm sure.<br /><br />Everything about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their 'all,' but it's like trying to improve on ""Casablanca"" -- it just can't be done! It's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake, and it just falls short, through no fault of the actors.","The attempt to remake the classic movie ""Bye Bye Birdie"" falls short as it fails to capture the charm of the original. Despite commendable performances by the actors and singers, the remake struggles to match up to the excellence of the original film. Comparisons to the original are inevitable and only highlight the shortcomings of the remake."
What was your impression of the casting choices in the movie?,"Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, croons so effectively, and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy. In his more cutesy moments (with the girl in the train station, in the final number with Rosie), I couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent. You keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. By the way, if you see a production of the stage musical, the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie, you'll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.","The casting of Jason Alexander as a romantic lead was completely unbelievable and off-putting. Despite his efforts, his performance came across as more creepy than endearing. Vanessa Williams was the standout star, outshining the rest of the cast. The constant revisions to the songs in different versions of the movie made the musical adaptation feel inconsistent."
What are some drawbacks of the film highlighted in the review?,"This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible. But this is inconsequential, as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Screenplays not always need be 'chatty', but they should at least assist the development of the story. Here one line attempts such as ""he just took off"" or ""I know you don't have love in heart"" just do fully evoke something worth the audience's time. Also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music. Talk about trying to hard. If you are interested in a good film, the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you.","The film's poor choices in production, undeveloped script, and reliance on cliché music montages detract from the overall quality and substance of the story."
What do you think about the overall quality of the film?,"I go to UCSB and take some classes with the executive producer, Alison Anders. She's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on, I thought must be pretty good. This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara film festival seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />While this movie included some nice shots and cinematography, the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish. My main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell. Bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground. The soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film, it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good.","While the cinematography was visually appealing, the film lacked a coherent story, suffered from bad acting, and had a weak screenplay, making it a disappointing viewing experience."
"What are some weaknesses of the movie ""Seven Pounds""?","Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu's Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks. The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie. That's too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically ""good"" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.","""Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre.

The storytelling is not very original and feels like an imitation of other films, lacking depth and authenticity. The characters Ben and Emily could have been more compelling if handled by a better director."""
Did the film Seven Pounds receive any positive feedback?,What can I say about Seven Pounds...well I watched on a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely didn't help. Will Smith's character Ben Thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end. The movie's two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible. In the movies defense Rosario Dawson's character adds a little life to the film although not much. I don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Also Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the ended proving that killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.,"Seven Pounds is a tedious and unlikable film that wastes its runtime on irrelevant plot points. Will Smith's character is unlikable and the movie's attempt at emotional depth falls flat. The ending, featuring a bizarre and nonsensical death scene, adds to the overall disappointing experience."
"What's your take on the portrayal of characters in ""The Corpse Vanishes""?","The Poverty Row horror pictures of the 1930s and '40s depress the hell out of me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but the ones produced in that period have such a dreary, shabby look about them--and, in the final analysis, just aren't very good. ""The Corpse Vanishes"" is slightly more entertaining than bottom-of-the-barrel dreck like ""The Invisible Ghost"" and ""The Ape Man"", but it's no classic. Bela Lugosi, long past his ""Dracula"" heyday, plays yet another mad doctor; the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a doubtful young female reporter (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also on hand, which might please hardcore fans of '30s and '40s films.","The Poverty Row horror pictures of the 1930s and '40s just leave me feeling down. These low-budget films from that era come across as dull and unimpressive. ""The Corpse Vanishes"" tries to be a tad more engaging, but it's far from being memorable. Bela Lugosi's performance as a mad doctor feels tired, and Elizabeth Russell's portrayal as his wife is simply unbearable. The storyline lacks originality, and the attempt at creating a creepy atmosphere falls flat. Overall, this film is forgettable and struggles to leave a lasting impression."
Was the low budget of the film noticeable in the visuals and production quality?,"Just looking at the sets, staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that. Young brides drop dead at the altar after saying ""I do"". Their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist Dr. Lorenz(Lugosi)and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife(Elizabeth Russell)needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young...forever beautiful. An eager local cub reporter(Luana Walters)realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be most knowledgeable. A typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the Lorenz estate a bit spooky; especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.","The film seems to rely heavily on its star, Bela Lugosi, to distract viewers from its lack of proper funding. The sets, editing, and staging all reflect a lower budget, making it challenging to fully immerse oneself in the story. Additionally, the plot feels predictable and cliché for a horror movie, with little originality to offer. Overall, the film's limited resources are apparent throughout, dampening the overall viewing experience."
"What makes ""The Corpse Vanishes"" stand out from other horror movies of its time?","""Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia. The good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty. What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter, where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sedating them into a coma-like state, he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie.<br /><br />** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell",This movie tries to rely too heavily on shock value and gore to compensate for its lacking plot and character development. The storyline feels disjointed and fails to evoke any real sense of suspense or thrills. The over-the-top acting and poorly executed special effects only add to the overall disappointment of this film.
What makes this horror film stand out from others in the 40s?,"Patricia Hunter: Oh, professor, do you also make a habit of collecting coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, in a manner of speaking. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. <br /><br />Interesting Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) vehicle where he plays the mad scientist. I was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping.<br /><br />Luana Walters (Girls in Prison) was really appealing as a sensual reporter, Patricia Hunter< who was to be a victim, but woman-power trumps evil scientist every time.<br /><br />2'11"" Angelo Rossitto and creepy Frank Moran , who liked to stoke the women's hair added to the film.<br /><br />Interesting look at a 40s horror film.","The film lacks suspense and relies too heavily on clichéd horror tropes.

Additionally, the characters lack depth and development, resulting in a superficial viewing experience. The plot is predictable, failing to offer any surprises or unique twists to captivate the audience. Overall, the film struggles to hold viewers' interest due to its shortcomings in storytelling and character portrayal."
What makes this horror film stand out from others in the genre?,"Bela Lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife. The midget in this film is hilarious!! A lot of freaks, plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless as you watch.<br /><br />Usually I'd score bore flicks like this one low, but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points.","Bela Lugosi plays an eccentric scientist in this film, using orchids to seduce women for his elderly wife's benefit. While some elements like the presence of a midget add a touch of creepiness, the lack of plot and interesting storyline turns this movie into a boring nightmare to sit through. The characters fail to engage the audience, leaving viewers feeling uninterested and frustrated."
What is the general consensus on the plot and acting of the movie?,"Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance/hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep Bela's wife eternally young. Some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi hams it up nicely, but you can tell he needed the money. <br /><br />This film is thoroughly awful, and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film. I got the DVD in a discount store 2 for £1, which I think is a pretty accurate valuation, anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind.",The movie is described as thoroughly awful with most actors better off waiting tables. The only saving grace seems to be the wonderfully ridiculous plot.
Would you recommend this documentary on the first moon landing to viewers looking for a factual and less sensationalized portrayal?,"You'd think the first landing on the Moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it. However, this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light. It talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other. It makes the computer overload problem (the 1202 and 1201 alarms) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near-catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all. And it takes the ""thirty seconds"" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out, when it's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory.<br /><br />If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go for ""From the Earth to the Moon"" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.","The documentary overly dramatizes the events surrounding the Apollo 11 mission, exaggerating risks and misrepresenting certain critical moments. It fails to provide an accurate and realistic depiction of the historic lunar landing, causing confusion and potentially misleading viewers. Instead, it is suggested to opt for other documentaries like ""From the Earth to the Moon"" or PBS productions for a more truthful account of the Apollo 11 mission."
What could have improved the overall viewing experience of the movie?,"I was hoping for some sort of in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked by over-hyped disaster-predicting sensationalising voice-over in the worst tradition of TV production.<br /><br />If you could cut out the voice-over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could've been great - but I feel I've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme. I want those minutes back.","I felt that the excessive use of sensationalizing voice-over in the documentary overshadowed the actual content and interviews with the people involved in the Apollo 11 mission. The potential for a deep dive into the background of the mission was missed, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time watching it. If the focus had been on showcasing the resilience and achievements of the individuals involved, rather than relying on overhyped disaster predictions, it could have been a much more enjoyable watch."
What did you think about the balance between teen drama and science fiction elements in the show?,"I had to endure teen-aged, high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show. I really do not care about high-school girls fretting about their relationships. I've spent my time in Hell dealing with such issues and I care nothing about fictional teenies going through ""lite"" versions of the horrors I endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. We FINALLY see a proto-Cylon. It was good but with one problem. Its red eye-dot would lock onto an object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. The red eye-dot does not ever stop moving back and forth.<br /><br />I really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode.","The excessive focus on teen drama and family conflict overshadowed the science fiction aspects that viewers were anticipating. The brief glimpse of a proto-Cylon with a malfunctioning eye-dot was a redeeming moment, but overall, the lack of balance left many wanting more meaningful sci-fi elements."
What are some of the issues viewers might have with the show?,"If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you, as fare as I am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just can't watch it anymore. It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100.000+ years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100.000 year old popular name brand LCD T.V. sets. It also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show, there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook, I think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad. As fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as BSG was and it is a poor pre sequel to it.","Some viewers may find the show uninteresting and slow-paced, with an unconvincing portrayal of a timeline set 100,000+ years ago. The presence of modern-day items such as Chevy vans and LCD TVs in this ancient setting may be disconcerting for some, making it difficult to fully immerse themselves in the show. Comparisons to ""Battlestar Galactica"" highlight that this show falls short in terms of quality and fails to live up to its potential as a prequel."
What makes this series fall short in comparison to other popular sci-fi shows?,"I realize it's not supposed to be BSG and I can handle slow-paced shows if they're interesting but I find myself completely uninterested and bored with this series.<br /><br />The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama<br /><br />the formula for Caprica seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi<br /><br />Maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 I can barely watch it. In fact, it's at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week. This is a sad state of affairs. The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night lineup. Whatever happened to the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis, and BSG on Friday nights? They had a good thing there.","The series lacks the engaging mix of action, adventure, suspense, and mystery that defined beloved shows like BSG, leaving it feeling dull and uninteresting. The slow-paced, bland drama fails to capture the viewer's attention, making it a struggle to watch even just a few episodes. It's a disappointing departure from the glory days of sci-fi shows on the Syfi channel."
What are viewers' expectations versus reality for the spin-off show of BG?,"Of course I was watching BG. I loved S1, I liked season 2, season 3 was OK, and loved the final one. Yay, there is a spin-off show! I didn't know about this at all, one of my friends told me about this. I was really excited.<br /><br />I watched the first 3 episodes... What a piece of rubbish! Teenage girl drama fest. There is no science fiction... well, hardly any. At the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a Cylon. That's all. Who cares this? Did they decide that the next show's target audience will be females under 18? Boring religious nonsense talking, moaning, bitching... and some more.<br /><br />It is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch. Stargate ruined, BG over...","The new spin-off show of BG has left viewers disappointed with its lack of science fiction elements and excess focus on teenage drama. The presence of Cylons is not enough to salvage the show from being labeled as boring and filled with unnecessary religious themes. Many fans feel let down by the direction the spin-off has taken, especially after being excited for its release."
What did you think of the spin-off show Caprica?,"What an awful show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is juvenile and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera. The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one spin off that should have never been made.","This show is a total disaster. It seems like Sci-Fi fans will watch anything these days, regardless of how terrible it is. Caprica is a prime example of everything that is wrong with modern science fiction television. The acting is amateurish and lacks any real emotion. The characters are poorly developed and are just stereotypes of typical Sci-Fi archetypes. The storyline is convoluted and uninteresting, and the dialogue is cringeworthy at best. The direction lacks finesse, and the sets are unimpressive. Caprica is an utter waste of time and a disgrace to the genre. This spin-off should never have seen the light of day."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find distasteful?,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen recently. When a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself I pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies. The bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public. From the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting, how long its been since they got some, when their next sexual liaison will be, and with whom it should be with. On top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes. This could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here. Please, do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it.","The reviewer found the movie to be filled with crass sexual humor, immature jokes, and over-the-top bedroom scenes. They criticized the poor dialogue, forced acting, and excessive focus on sex rather than meaningful content. The reviewer expressed disappointment in the execution of the interesting concept, deeming it more suited for 14-year-old male fantasies than mature audiences."
What aspects of the movie did the reviewer find disappointing and why?,"if they gave me the option of negative numbers I'd use it. This movie was truly god-awful. I went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible, and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations.<br /><br />The script was weak, the acting was painful. I wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth, I think we were both disappointed.<br /><br />The growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain, he came off as oddly weak and silly. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came off as psychotic and strange, as did Matt's (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.","The reviewer found the script weak, the acting painful, and the casting choices for the super villain and supporting characters to be off-putting. The physical changes the female characters underwent were also criticized as being inappropriate."
What makes this movie unappealing to watch repeatedly on cable television?,"This movie is being shown over and over on cable lately, so..<br /><br />There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either Luke Wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie. The female actresses are very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it is 'funny' that Luke's even uglier/dorkier/stupider friend is around, but well, that is what we get.<br /><br />Neither of the female leads would ever, EVER talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in Friday the 13th 4. Dead *@$#","The storyline relies heavily on two attractive female characters fighting over two superficial male characters, making it difficult to believe the interactions among them. The portrayal of the male characters as unremarkable and the excessive drama and conflict further diminish the film's watchability."
What were some missed opportunities in the film?,"I'm a huge fan of Ivan Reitman-I loved Evolution and who didn't like Ghostbusters? From the trailer you already know that Uma's character will get dumped by Luke's.So the build-up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him.But the pay-off is just not there.The shark tossing did manage to get a (slight) giggle but once again, it was all in the trailer.<br /><br />No one does breathless quite like Uma and Luke is diet Owen on his good days.If not for Riann Wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp.This is a comedy,right? <br /><br />It's not awful-it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge.This could have been such a brilliant send-up of Superhero movies and Feminism but fails on both counts.Let's see if Jason Reitman can salvage the family name.","The film lacked a satisfying pay-off despite the promising build-up towards Uma's character unleashing her superpowers on Luke. The humor fell flat for the most part and the potential for a brilliant send-up of superhero movies and feminism was not realized. It felt like a stale cracker left behind the fridge, leaving the audience with only a slight giggle and a constipated smile, waiting for something more engaging."
What were your thoughts on the special effects and acting in the film?,"I went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film, I was still bitterly disappointed! I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT bad!!! The storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible (even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film heavily relied on its special effects...but they personally had no effect on me. I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film. It is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this film... You'll live to regret it lol!","It was a total waste of money with a disgraceful storyline, terrible acting, and heavy reliance on special effects that had no impact. It is strongly advised to avoid watching this film to prevent future disappointment."
Do you think the movie improved after the first hour?,"Needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried - left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry.<br /><br />I don't recall ever walking out on a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the cast and just kept ""going and going"" badly - come on! Uma Thurman doing this stuff? Fairly lame special effects. These were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling.<br /><br />This review is base only on the first hour - it might have gotten better. I just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on.","The film was extremely disappointing with a lackluster script that did not match the talented cast. The special effects were subpar, and seeing older actors portraying superficial young characters felt annoying and out of place. The overall experience was so unbearable that the audience member left midway to watch paint dry, a decision that speaks volumes about the film's quality."
What made this movie disappointing for the viewer?,"Well I must say this is probably the worst film I have seen this year! The jokes were extremely crude (wasn't expecting it from as PG movie)(Rated PG in Canada) and they weren't funny! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I didn't even get that. I am a huge Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed by his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them. I didn't expect this at all as in the past I have really liked other movies by this director (Six Days, Seven Nights for example) This movie was NOT worth the $10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie. I guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over.","The film had extremely crude jokes that fell flat and were not enjoyable. Despite having a great cast, the acting was subpar, with even a usually favorite actor, Rainn Wilson, delivering a disappointing performance. The characters played by Luke Wilson and Uma Thurman were unlikable, making it hard for the viewer to care about their outcomes. Overall, this movie was not worth the price of admission and is one to avoid."
What's your take on a movie featuring an Ex Girlfriend with super powers concept?,I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. I figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with super powers. <br /><br />... but the movie was confused and pointless ...<br /><br />it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in. Also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love.<br /><br />It seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of Fatal Attraction Super hero .. but I guess not. <br /><br />This is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be. You could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date. <br /><br />If the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up - the movie might have a fighting chance. <br /><br />A serious waste of time.<br /><br />B,"The movie was confusing, adding unnecessary elements such as toilet humor and sexual situations that made it uncomfortable to watch. It failed to deliver on the advertised fun romantic comedy and ended up being a serious waste of time."
Was the film able to deliver the promised absurd humor and engaging action scenes?,"I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I wasn't disappointed. She looked gorgeous. Second of all, through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca's films. On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. I kept watching until the end, but I got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.","Unfortunately, the movie failed to live up to expectations, as the jokes were predictable and the characters lacked depth, making them uninteresting to follow. The action scenes were also uninspired and lacked any sense of excitement or drama, leaving the audience feeling bored and disengaged throughout the film."
"What were some of the major flaws you found in the movie ""The Gospel of Lou""?","The Gospel of Lou was a major disappointment for me. I had received an E-Mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie. It was neither great nor inspirational. The cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie. A lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also many of the people in the movie were far fetched. The relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear. Also the whole movie has most him one way, and then all of a sudden BAM, he is cured and inspiring people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way that he is living it, but when he changes, he doesn't leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. Thumbs Down.","The cinematography was inconsistent and the flashbacks were confusing, with distorted voices and unrealistic characters. The main character's transformation felt sudden and unconvincing, and the portrayal of boxing as a negative influence in his life was contradicted by him teaching boxing in the end. Overall, the movie failed to live up to expectations and fell short of being inspirational."
Was the humor in the movie able to appeal to a wider audience or was it more tailored to a specific type of viewer?,"After two long, long opening skits, one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free, we start the fast-forward fest that it GROOVE TUBE proper. Naturally, uber-stupid frat boys who still mainline JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube, SEX OLYMPICS(I really don't need to give you details, do I), and a clown who basically does the ""not very endearing clown"" bit I think I've seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles: well, more power to you.<br /><br />I just want to express that, despite what you've heard, this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what not. The skit movie had already been done in AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and so on. And done way better.","The movie's attempt at humor fell flat for many viewers, with crude and predictable jokes that failed to deliver the expected laughs. The reliance on shock value and juvenile humor may have only resonated with a limited audience, leaving much to be desired in terms of originality and entertainment value."
What were some of the issues that the reviewer had with the movie?,"Rented it last night. The opening(2001) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long. The hitchiker scene served no purpose. Some skits were just retarded. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts:<br /><br />KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song<br /><br />Total: 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie<br /><br />Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell.<br /><br />Let me give you some advice: If you want a crude movie spoofing TV and movies, rent ""Kentucky Fried Movie"". If you want a less crude movie spoofing TV and movies, rent ""AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON"" or ""UHF""<br /><br />Otherwise, don't bother renting this movie. You'll save 2-3 dollars.<br /><br />IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best movie is STILL ""Modern Problems""","The reviewer felt that the opening scene was overly extended, the hitchiker scene was unnecessary, some skits were deemed as senseless, and a majority of the content was either unfunny or ridiculous. They advised against renting the movie unless one is specifically looking for crude humor and suggested better alternatives like ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" or ""AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON""."
Do you think the movie is worth watching for its political commentary or comedic value?,"Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the gang at SNL set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level. Fortunately Chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe. It seriously is very, very bad. While meant to be a political comment on USA at the time of it's release (1974) it still remains neither funny or acutely observed. The sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom. This is credited as Chevy's movie debut and I'm pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it. Avoid even if curious.","Oh dear, this movie is a complete mess. While Chevy Chase is hardly in it, the sketches are drawn out and lack any satirical impact. The attempt at political commentary falls flat, making the movie boring and unenjoyable. This movie is one to avoid, even out of curiosity."
Was the movie as hilarious as expected?,"Hearing about how hilarious this movie is, I finally rent it at<br /><br />the video store and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times. This<br /><br />movie, a collection of skits that make fun of television is an<br /><br />incoherrent mess. The jokes fall flat, the humor deals with<br /><br />issues from the 1970's that just aren't relevant anymore, and<br /><br />the jokes go on way too long (almost like the new SNL skits the<br /><br />past few years). Yeah, Chevy Chase is in this but maybe of all<br /><br />about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that this was very<br /><br />raunchy and had nudity galore but couldn't it be funny? Do<br /><br />yourself a favor and rent Kentucky Fried Movie which is a far<br /><br />superior film made in the","Although a lot of hype surrounded the movie and its supposed hilarity, upon watching it, the humor fell flat and outdated. The skits were confusing and lacked coherence, with jokes that dragged on for too long, reminiscent of current SNL skits. Despite the presence of Chevy Chase and ample nudity, the attempts at raunchiness failed to elicit genuine laughter. The movie ultimately failed to deliver the comedic punch it promised, leaving viewers disappointed and longing for a more superior comedy like ""Kentucky Fried Movie""."
What makes this film stand out from the other movies you have watched before?,"The only film I've ever walked out on. Amazing, since I paid for myself and my date and I'm really cheap. But my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on, particularly since I could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged.<br /><br />From the beginning to the end this film offends. Worse, it ain't funny. It wasn't funny then, and it sure ain't funny now. But even worse, is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart, sophisticated comedy. It's juvenile, really sophomoric script and ideas began an era (which continues to this day) where cheap laughs, and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film.<br /><br />Sexual Olympics? What High School kid hasn't thought of that? The beginning of the end.","Well, I have to be honest, I've never walked out of a movie before watching this one. This film was a complete disaster from start to finish. The humor was not just juvenile, it was downright offensive and cringeworthy. It felt like a cheap attempt at comedy that fell flat on its face. The so-called jokes and the overall concept were not just unfunny, but also left a bad taste in my mouth. This film represents everything I dislike about modern comedy in movies - relying on cheap laughs and sexual innuendo instead of clever wit and genuine humor. It's a shame to see such a decline in the quality of comedy films, with this movie being a prime example of how low the bar has been set."
"Would you recommend ""Dressed to Kill"" to someone looking for a sophisticated and well-written thriller film with a coherent plot?","A repressed housewife (an annoying lisping Angie Dickinson, whose body double treats/horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch-out. This directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, clearly I am in the wrong business if SHE can bring home $600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you are going to watch De Palma rip off (excuse me, ""pay homage to"") Hitchcock, watch ""Sisters"" instead of this. ""Dressed to Kill,"" while loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the tackiest thrillers I have had the displeasure of sitting through. The plot is absurd and tired. It does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan, as long as they can get past the silly story line, that must have been dated even in 1980.","While ""Dressed to Kill"" boasts stylish direction and technical expertise, the film ultimately falls flat due to its absurd and tired plot. The story feels silly and dated, making it a displeasurable watch for those seeking a sophisticated and well-written thriller. The movie may offer effective jump scares and graphic murder sequences for horror fans, but these elements do not compensate for the lack of a coherent storyline. Consider exploring other thrillers like ""Sisters"" for a more fulfilling viewing experience."
"What are the main flaws in ""Dressed To Kill""?","A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. ""Dressed To Kill"" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own ""Carrie""--not to mention ""Psycho"". The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock, not an homage. Stylish in a steely cold way, the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from ****","The movie ""Dressed To Kill"" is pretentious in its direction, with Brian De Palma going overboard with fancy camera techniques that give away the plot too easily. The acting is mostly mediocre and the film's attempts to pay tribute to Hitchcock fall flat, coming off more like a spoof. The finale feels like a rip-off of De Palma's previous works, leaving the overall result feeling half-baked and unsatisfying."
What aspects of the film were disappointing according to the review given?,"I can find very little thats good to say about this film. I am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting I am afraid is not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I would doubt that this features highly in their CV Filmography. Michael Caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the Doctor, and at no time no did I actually believe in his character. The plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, that at times I wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller. The lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars, wondering why I bothered to watch it at all.","The film fell short in terms of filmography, acting, and believability, with some scenes appearing reminiscent of other films and leaving the viewer feeling like they were watching a low-budget movie. The acting, particularly by Michael Caine, came across as wooden and lacking depth, making it difficult to believe in the characters on screen."
What are some criticisms of the remake of this film?,"There is absolutely NO reason to waste your time with this ""film"". The original said it all and still holds up. Either read the book or do some research about the story, and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! Having been to Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, the sets and locations looked NOTHING like Kansas. The original is riveting, from the location filming to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims belongings. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall...The original is available on DVD in widescreen now. Let this turkey die a quick death.","The remake's lack of authenticity, poor casting choices, and failure to accurately portray the Kansas setting significantly detract from the viewing experience. The original version is far superior in terms of location filming, performances, and overall execution."
What elements of the original film are missing in this remake?,"This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. Nothing new or original is added other than Perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. Also painfully missing is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. I can't understand any high ratings for this at all. It's quite bad. Why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did I waste time watching it?","This movie is a pointless remake that fails to capture the raw urgency and documentary feel of the original. The addition of Perry's backflashes does little to enhance the film, and the absence of the iconic Quincy Jones soundtrack further diminishes its appeal. Overall, it's quite bad and a waste of time for both filmmakers and viewers."
What were some of the major drawbacks of the movie BOOGEYMAN according to a reviewer?,"1 is being pretty generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, even though it is not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it! It creeped me out. But this film, it is something else. For being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies, it looks like it was shot on a VHS camcorder by a 10 year old! The story and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you have let me down too. After playing one of the most menacing villains in film history, you have resorted to this? The story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however, if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional. There are a LOT of shot on video films out there that don't look like it, or at least aren't so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film. I can't say it is the worst movie ever, because I couldn't make it through the entire film, but it is certainly close.","The reviewer criticized the poor quality of the film, mentioning that it looked like it was shot by a 10 year old on a VHS camcorder. They expressed disappointment in the story and acting, particularly calling out the performance of actor David Hess. The reviewer found the overall production unprofessional and distracting, making it difficult to even finish watching the movie."
"Do you think the show actually helps some people, or does it only anger the people who watch it?","does anyone think that this show actually helps some people, or does it only anger the people who watch it? when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity. i understand that pat Roberson is not all together. what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say. pat Roberson is of little consequence. he is an old man who thinks in an old way. fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did (thank god). now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity.","Some viewers find this show to be a source of morbid curiosity and question whether it truly benefits anyone or just provokes anger. Pat Roberson's outdated and fear-based messaging is deemed ineffective by some, with doubts about the positive impact on viewers."
What message does the movie convey about the importance of understanding and tolerance between different belief systems?,"I turn on 700 Club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made- I'm one of many believers that is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non-Christians. I vote my mind, and its usually not rep. or dem. - i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe, but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds. i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club. it bums me out to hear name calling either direction. i think 700 club folks really do love Jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did. Please don't judge Jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on Him and let's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them. Why ARE people so mean to each other?","The movie fails to adequately address the issue of promoting love and acceptance towards all groups, leading to a narrow-minded portrayal of certain characters and beliefs. The overarching focus on promoting conservatism overshadows the necessity of showing compassion and promoting peace, ultimately resulting in a one-dimensional representation of complex issues."
"Do you think the film ""BACK OF BEYOND"" was able to effectively utilize the talents of the actors, especially Paul Mercurio?",Pointless boring film with charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson has morphed into a Director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia's greatest exports on screen. Roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time.,"Sadly, ""BACK OF BEYOND"" fails to deliver on its potential with a pointless and boring storyline that completely wastes the charismatic performance of Paul Mercurio. The film seems to have been released haphazardly, failing to capture the interest of the audience in Sydney. The local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio are also underutilized in this project, leaving much to be desired.Overall, the film is a disappointment and a waste of talent and time."
Can you delve deeper into the character development of Gretchen Mol's role in the film?,"I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and don't really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.<br /><br />She really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again.<br /><br />The photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.<br /><br />Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever.",Gretchen Mol's performance lacked depth and failed to fully explore the complexities of her character's journey from naivety to rediscovering her religion. This made it challenging for the audience to truly connect with her emotional arc throughout the film.
Would you recommend this movie to someone who takes music seriously?,"Well that's 90 minutes of my life I won't get back. This movie makes teen tv show ""California Dreams"" look like ""Almost Famous"". The acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic. Don't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, look etc.. You had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one. The guitarist is seen to be a heroin user, not that I blame him, if I was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting I'd be injecting the horse too.<br /><br />If you take music remotely seriously, avoid this at all costs.","Well that's 90 minutes of my life I won't get back.

What are some disappointments mentioned in the review?,"Now, I won't deny that when I purchased this off eBay, I had high expectations. This was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy that I so enjoy. However, I was soon to be disappointed. Apologies to those who enjoyed it, but I just found the Compleat Al to be very difficult to watch. I got a few smiles, sure, but the majority of the funny came from the music videos (which I've got on DVD) and the rest was basically filler. You could tell that this was not Al's greatest video achievement (that honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt if this will ever make the jump to DVD, so if you're an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just HAVE to own everything, buy the tape off eBay. Just don't pay too much for it.","The reviewer found the Compleat Al very difficult to watch, with most of the humor coming from music videos already owned on DVD and the rest feeling like filler. They suggest that this video is not Weird Al's best work and may not be worth owning, especially at a high price."
Was the plot of this movie engaging enough to keep the audience interested throughout?,"Think ""stage play"". This is worth seeing once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. COmpare the Melvyn DOuglas in ""Ghost Story"" with the Melvyn DOuglas of this film. Are there vampires at loose in this 'Bavarian' village, or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinister, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is cast as an especially moronic character. It's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character. NOt much happens for a long time, but then we discover that Atwill's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer. There is too much 'comic relief' but that is par for the course for this era. Fay Wray looks really good.",
What aspects of the movie failed to resonate with the audience or critics?,"CLASS OF '61 <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />In 1861, class members from the West Point Academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the Civil War.<br /><br />Gregory Hoblit's OK historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict - though the production seems a little stilted, despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), toplined by Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery, pitting him in direct conflict with his former Northern friends. The movie's emphasis on such a misguided - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is efficient rather than inspired.","The movie ""Class of '61"" attempts to deliver a poignant message about the impact of war on virtuous individuals, but ultimately falls short in its execution. Despite a talented cast and authentic period details, the production feels stilted and fails to evoke genuine emotion. The emphasis on a sympathetic but misguided character is commendable, but the overall drama comes across as flat and superficial. Gregory Hoblit's direction lacks inspiration, leading to a lackluster viewing experience."
What are some of the criticisms mentioned in the reviews and what opportunities did the movie miss?,"A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest. His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.<br /><br />There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means. Cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor. Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes!","The movie's remake failed to capture the depth and intrigue of the original film, with Tom Cruise delivering a lackluster and soulless performance that lacked any true emotional connection. The reliance on Cruise's persona rather than delving into the character's complexity left the audience disengaged, failing to generate any genuine chemistry between the characters. The movie missed the chance to explore deeper layers of the story and characters, ultimately falling short of recreating the magic of the original film."
Did the movie live up to the standards of a good comedy film?,"This wasn't the major disaster that I was expecting, but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime talk show. I didn't get too bored watching this, but I was definitely never enjoying it, either. If you're in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that isn't too painful to sit through, this is a good choice.","The movie falls flat when it comes to humor, filled with dull and uninteresting characters whose actions are more cringe-worthy than funny. It seems to rely on tired stereotypes and lacks any originality or wit that would make it stand out as a comedy. Overall, it fails to deliver genuine laughs and leaves the audience feeling underwhelmed."
What aspects of the movie failed to capture the essence of the Jerry Springer Show?,"Somebody could probably make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-TV phenomenon. There are dozens of famously bad movies (e.g. ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"") that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary, witless waste of film.<br /><br />Seriously, why not a documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, that would begin to answer some of the real questions like: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How did the mayor of Cincinatti find himself here?<br /><br />One good line: During an ""orientation"" session for guests: ""People, I can't emphasize this enough: NO WEAPONS!""","The fictionalized version of the Jerry Springer Show drained anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-TV phenomenon, lacking creativity and spirit. Some famously bad movies show more creativity and entertainment value than this dreary, witless waste of film. The movie missed the opportunity to delve into the real questions surrounding the show's guests, their lives, and how they end up on the show, opting for a shallow portrayal instead."
What makes this movie a complete disaster?,"The only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the TV show. This is also the main reason that fans of the TV show won't like the movie, but not the only reason. This movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal. It approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making, and then gets even worse. I won't waste your time describing this movie in further detail; suffice it to say that I pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this c**p the first time.","This movie is an absolute train wreck from start to finish. It completely lacks the charm and entertainment value of the TV show it's based on, leaving fans utterly disappointed. The plot is weak, the acting is cringeworthy, and the overall experience is as enjoyable as a root canal. It's a shame that any camera person had to witness the disaster that is this film."
"Do you think that ""Ringmaster"" is worth watching despite the negative reviews?","Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First of all, it was made. Second of all, people went to see it. Third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good. Most crappy movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had a few cool special effects) this film's moment was when I left the theater nauseated. The only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to stare at crap for an hour and a half, i'll take a dump in a can. If anyone didn't utterly despise this movie, I pity you, and your children, and your children's children's children; however, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I clearly don't condone children having sex.",
What makes this film a total waste of time according to the review?,"Oh Dear, Jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game, and he's way out of his league. The script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as Michael Dudikoff (80's action B'movie king), Michael Jai White (Last seen in the Sci Fi flop Spawn') as well as Surviving the Games' William MacNamara (who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film!) stoop this low for employment. If you are a fan of Jerry then stick to his TV show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half. After I had finished sitting through this I managed to catch the last half an hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison, I think that says more than enough!!!<br /><br />","The script is extremely poor, the actors are stooping low for employment, and the movie overall is a disappointment even for fans of Jerry Springer. Comparing it to the last half an hour of Rocky 5 makes it look like a cinematic masterpiece."
"What are the reasons why the reviewer did not enjoy the movie ""Ringmaster""?","For the life of me, I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's so incrediably trashy. Some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping ""Ringmaster"". Just watch the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's more enjoyable than this.<br /><br />2/10","The reviewer found ""Ringmaster"" to be incredibly trashy and a bad attempt at capturing the essence of the ""Jerry Springer Show."" They criticized the acting, particularly Jerry Springer's performance, and felt that Jamie Pressley's appearance was not enough to salvage the movie. The reviewer ultimately rated the movie 2 out of 10 and recommended skipping it in favor of watching the actual ""Jerry Springer Show."""
What makes this movie a terrible viewing experience?,"You don't need to write a script for this trashed outrage! You just sit back and watch a pair of moonshine women and guests duke each other out before a riotous audience exposure at ""The Jerry Show""! Violent and obnoxious, this cash-in on the real Jerry Springer program reveals everything that the over-rated hyped talk show doesn't show to you on the air - - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of ""Cops"". Even the outside world of Springerland reveals the most amateurish acting of the decade! This goes to show you that THE GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a motion picture turkey. Change the channel! REJECTED<br /><br />","This movie is a chaotic mess of outrageous behavior and poor acting that fails to entertain the audience. The attempt to capitalize on the success of the Jerry Springer show falls flat, with unconvincing performances and lackluster storytelling. It's a cringeworthy spectacle that lacks any redeeming qualities, making it a complete waste of time for anyone seeking quality entertainment. Save yourself the trouble and skip this cinematic disaster."
What makes this movie stand out from other films about show business?,"OK, people, honestly... this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz that's ever been made, but I've been laughing myself silly (which may be why I enjoyed it). Basically, it's all about sex, sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a major issue in this movie? If you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and don't have something better to do). <br /><br />***Attention spoilers!!!*** The funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked Jerry whether he could marry his goat (!) on the show and flashing his wallet with his love's pictures. A triple A for bad taste and fun!","I don't think this movie is anything special. It's filled with crude humor and an overemphasis on sex, which can make it quite uncomfortable to watch. The storyline seems to revolve around shocking scenes rather than a cohesive plot, and the characters come across as more bizarre than interesting. Overall, it's a film that relies heavily on shock value rather than substance or quality storytelling."
What are some aspects of the movie that were particularly disappointing?,"Really an amazing pile of pap! <br /><br />A predictable, slow moving, soul destroying, mind numbing movie to which, slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems... well, almost necessary.<br /><br />The acting is over done for the thin dialogue, every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be, the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words. The music would be good if you didn't have to sit through the movie, but really, three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie.<br /><br />Watching this film I prayed to God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me.<br /><br />Never, ever, ever again.","The movie was described as predictable, slow-moving, and soul-destroying. The acting was criticized for being overdone compared to the sparse dialogue, with scenes dragging on longer than necessary. The intricate details of the characters' careers were deemed dreary and mundane. The soundtrack received some praise, but it was not enough to make sitting through the film worth it, as expressed in the reviewer's extreme aversion to watching it again."
What aspects of the film did the reviewer dislike and feel were unnecessary?,"This film is a huge steaming pile. <br /><br />I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland/Mason version needed to be redone, nor why Striesand would have been a first choice to star.<br /><br />For that matter, I have no idea why our people (Gay Americans) tend largely to regard Striesand as some kind of treasure. At least in my opinion, she had peaked professionally with with Funny Girl, and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent the Judy classic, or even the original (a fine film in its own right), but please, Please, PLEASE skip this stinkpot!","The reviewer found the film to be a disappointment, questioning the need for a remake of the Garland/Mason version and the casting choice of Barbara Streisand. They expressed a preference for the classic Judy Garland film and suggested skipping this remake altogether."
What could have been done better to make the movie more engaging for the audience?,"I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so have no means of comparison. Also, it's been some years, but I found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating. The movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn out, disillusioned rock star on the decline, embarking upon a romance with a fresh, talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline.<br /><br />The lead actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me. The film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect, Streisand's beautiful rendition of the Oscar winning song 'Evergreen'. She truly has a powerful and magnificent voice.","The movie lacks a captivating storyline and fails to create a strong connection between the lead actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand. The romance between the characters feels unconvincing and lacks chemistry, making it difficult for the audience to become emotionally invested in their relationship. Overall, the film falls short in delivering a compelling narrative that keeps viewers engaged throughout."
"Can the remake of ""A Star is Born"" in 1976 hold up against the original 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason?","This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that is a shame because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I am not denying Barbra Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I am not acquainted with Kris Kristofferson's other work and therefore I can't pass judgment on it. However, this movie leaves much to be desired. It is paced slowly, it has gratuitous nudity and foul language, and can be very difficult to sit through.<br /><br />However, I am not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better. See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris, and judge for yourself.","The 1976 version of ""A Star is Born"" starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson falls short in comparison to the 1954 classic. The remake is slow-paced, includes unnecessary nudity and excessive swearing, making it a challenging watch. Fans of the original may find it lacking in comparison and might struggle to enjoy this version."
What makes the film fall short in delivering a compelling and engaging storyline?,"It doesn't even merit a review, other than as a warning to potential viewers. It's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a WWII period drama. There's no fear involved, no suspense whatsoever, nor any surprises. One shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and dull, although there is some really nice editing once in a while. The story never comes together, and the films is really just a total bust. 4/10.","The movie fails to create a captivating and suspenseful atmosphere, lacking any element of fear or surprise. The visual style is mundane and the storytelling feels disjointed, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience. The only saving grace is occasional decent editing, but overall, it's a forgettable and lackluster film."
What are some major drawbacks or flaws in this movie?,"I remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again, I wonder why. I guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down. Why oh why in so many English films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls? What is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the Confessions films but about a third of the way through (whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai) the film asks us to start taking it seriously. Not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted. In short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend. Richard O'Sullivan maybe, as such a central figure, could have helped but I reckon this to be one of his worst performances. Just worth it for the ladies.","While the film may have its moments and a decent performance from the female actors, the male characters fall flat and fail to deliver. The attempt to shift from a sex farce to a more serious tone halfway through feels forced and unconvincing. The central sequences around a rock club and cannabis come across as artificial and lacking authenticity. Overall, the film struggles to find the right balance between being silly and serious, resulting in a disappointing viewing experience. Richard O'Sullivan's performance is also criticized as one of his worst."
What is the main draw for viewers interested in watching this movie?,"The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory.<br /><br />Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of ""posh totty"" to have been committed to celluloid. Of her era and ilk, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.<br /><br />As a whole, the movie is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply made. The song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling.","The movie is largely considered to be of poor quality with cheap production value, featuring an opening credits song that is described as appalling."
What makes this movie stand out from other gangsta flicks?,"I got this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and that probably keeps going on..) Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap, as is the entire movie. Gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I´ve seen in my life, a very simple plot, it made me laugh ´till my stomach hurt! With very few financial resources, I must admit it looked pretty professional. Seen as a movie, it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobody´s waiting for. So: if you´re tired and want a cheap laugh, see this movie. If not, throw it out of the window.","The movie's low-budget production is evident throughout, with cheap visuals and amateurish actors that fail to deliver a compelling performance. The sound effects are poorly executed, making gunshots and fist fights seem comically unrealistic. The plot is predictable and lacks depth, leaving viewers unimpressed and struggling to find any redeeming qualities. Overall, this movie is forgettable and not worth watching unless you're looking for a laugh at its expense."
What makes this movie stand out as one of the worst films you have ever seen?,"I don't really know where to start. The acting in this movie was really terrible, I can't remember seeing so many 'actors' in one film that weren't able to act. Not only the acting was bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well.<br /><br />Then there's the action. I believe that even children know that when someone gets shot, there's blood involved. But when someone gets shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there's no blood at all. Well, I guess that's just me.<br /><br />To make a long story short (because believe me, I can go on for hours about this film), this is without a doubt the worst film I ever saw. This film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt.","The acting in this movie was subpar, with a cast that lacked any real talent. The characters were poorly developed and came off as extremely unintelligent. Additionally, the lack of realistic blood effects in the action scenes made the movie seem amateurish and unbelievable. Overall, this film failed to deliver on multiple levels, earning it a spot among the worst films ever made."
What are some aspects of the film that were heavily criticized?,"I bought this DVD for £1 and now i realise why. The acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. The lighting and sound are shoddy at best. The plot makes little sense even when sober (WARNING: I don't advise watching this film when sober.) This film feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't get out much. It really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste, I look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career, other than eva longoria who is the only ""star"" of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick. I'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but I will say one thing to James Cahill, don't try it again. In the words of squirlyem ""Its severely lacking in the good department"".","The film's acting was subpar, the lighting and sound quality were poor, the plot was nonsensical even for a sober viewer. It felt like watching a home movie of someone with no social life. The budget was wasted, with only Eva Longoria escaping the bad acting. Overall, the film severely lacked in quality and didn't leave a positive impression on the audience."
Can you provide a negative review of the movie based on the following positive reviews?,"WORST MOVIE EVER!!!! Can't believe I wasted 90min of my life watching this crap. The only reason I didn't turn it off was I wanted to see the Gangster dude on the cover and he wasn't even in it talk about False advertising. The people that gave this movie a ten are either Dumb,Stupid or CAST MEMBERS or friends of CAST MEMBERS.<br /><br />I gave it a solid 2 because no one else did<br /><br />I have to write more and I don't even want to. wasting my time talking about this rubbish. Please don't watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs. bottom 100 movies. i can't even tell you how bad it really is. think the worst movie ever that you've seen then times that be ten and thats this movie. It sucked!! If you just think I'm being bitter then watch it I dare You!! This movie should be used to torture war criminals or Terriosts. If they Watch this even two times and they'll be spilling the beans and begging for MERCY!!","This movie is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish! The action scenes are breathtaking, the plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat, and the performances by the lead actors are top-notch. The special effects are mind-blowing, and the cinematography is simply stunning. This is a must-see movie for any action lover!"
What are some of the critiques of the movie?,"I watched this....let me rephrase...suffered through this because I'm a fan of Eva's. I don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos. I like gangsta flix but this wasn't even close. The budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent on the caterer.<br /><br />The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not.<br /><br />I won't bother saying who did what and how, because it isn't worth the effort. I'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that I didn't have to actually pay for this garbage.<br /><br />OH!! Before you flame on me, I love movies, I thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed, so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know.","The movie received a scathing review from a fan of the lead actress, who expressed disappointment in the film's poor quality and low budget production. The reviewer found the premise interesting but felt the characters were not well-developed, with the first victim dying before any emotional connection could be established. The overall sentiment was that the movie was not worth watching, and the reviewer was grateful not to have spent money on it."
What makes Snitch'd the worst gangbanger movie ever made?,All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about. If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research. It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. This movie was tough as an after school special. Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from?. I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang. That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related. <br /><br />Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made.,"The movie lacks authenticity in portraying gangsters, with laughable scenes and unrealistic gang behavior. The director's lack of understanding of the subject matter is evident, making it a painful watch for viewers. It fails to capture the essence of gang culture, resulting in a comical and absurd portrayal of gang members."
What are some flaws in this movie?,"If you want to see a retarded homosexual Karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe Mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr, then this is the film for you. if not then choose another DVD from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs. the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end. The cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap, b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g's and a key, bloody streetz and menace. I would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot , editing and acting really don't matter to you. it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity!!!","The movie was poorly acted, with a ridiculous plot and amateurish editing. It belongs in the bargain bin and is not worth watching unless you don't care about quality. The cover is deceiving, making it seem cooler than it actually is. It falls flat compared to other gangster films and is not worth buying or renting. This movie is a complete waste of time and likely one of the worst films ever made."
"Based on what you've read about the movie, would you recommend it to a friend?","Maybe this isn't fair, because I only made it about halfway through the movie. One of the few movies I have actually not been able to watch due to lameness.<br /><br />The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during a coke deal, the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase - I'm no expert, but I think people generally put it in a bag.<br /><br />They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it's that over the top 'crunching' sound"" and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects.<br /><br />Worst movie ever.","The movie's poor acting, camera work, and unrealistic plot make it incredibly difficult to watch. From loose coke in a briefcase during a deal to unrealistic sound effects, this movie falls flat on every level. It's described as one of the worst movies ever, and for good reason."
What plot elements and acting choices were criticized in the movie?,"This movie is weak ,The box-cover says East LA's toughest gang and it is really Santa Ana's , James Cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough Chlo gang . It is fake , boring , senseless and whack , I tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad . It was also on the homo-erotic tip far from what the video-box proclaims . James Cahill should act in Gay Porno .James is in every scene , he cannot act to save his life . The film features Eva Longoria who is hot but James can't even score with her !!!!!!!!! I felt at times I was watching Gay Porn and was turned - off by the whole film . James clearly want's to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again . His martial Arts skills are minimal at best , Some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one .","The movie was heavily criticized for its fake depiction of gang life, boring and senseless storyline, and the actor James Cahill's unconvincing performance. Reviewers felt that the film was misleading based on its box cover and that it delved into homo-erotic themes that were off-putting. James Cahill's lackluster acting skills, particularly in comparison to co-star Eva Longoria, were highlighted as a major downfall of the movie. The repetitive fight scenes and minimal martial arts skills displayed by the main character were also pointed out as lacking authenticity."
What are some common criticisms of the film?,"DD films were damn corny, damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at least<br /><br />This film isn't just a comedy but a mix of melodrama, romance everything<br /><br />Every drama scene is blown out of proportion<br /><br />The comedy is funny but corny too Yet the film keeps you entertained, those days Govinda films were loud, crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyed<br /><br />David Dhawan does a okay job Music is okay<br /><br />Govinda acts well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts Kader is as usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra are typecast Shakti is hilarious","Some viewers may find the humor to be too over-the-top and corny, the plot thin and predictable, and certain performances irritating."
Could this movie be considered a good example of character development and a well-structured plot?,"I first saw this when I was around 7. I remembered what I believed to be a vague outline of what took place. Turns out now, 15 years later, that I remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story. There is no plot to this movie/cartoon. There is no character development, no back story, no character arcs, nothing. The good guys do things because they are good, while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad. One unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least. They just shrug their shoulders and move on. There's barely any dialogue either. If you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes, you lose 70% of the movie.<br /><br />Watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason. Or if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks (or scantily clad hot cartoon dudes).","This movie lacks character development, a solid plot, and meaningful dialogue. The story feels shallow with good guys being good just because and bad guys being bad for no reason. The lack of emotional impact when important characters die and the minimal dialogue make it difficult to engage with the film. The excessive focus on fight and running scenes leaves little substance to the overall experience."
What elements of the film might deter audiences who are not die-hard fans of the genre?,"Trite, clichéd dialog and plotting (the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies), hokey music, and a paint-by-numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans.<br /><br />What saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, the rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta...in motion. The violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the period.<br /><br />I like to watch this with the sound off, playing the soundtrack to the first Conan movie instead.","Trite and clichéd dialogues, predictable plotlines reminiscent of 1980s fantasy movies, cheesy music, and one-dimensional characters may fail to engage viewers beyond hardcore fans."
"What are some major flaws of the movie ""Il Mio Miglior Nemico""?","Carlo Verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism.<br /><br />Then something happened, and he turned into just another dull ""holier-than-thou"" director.<br /><br />Il Mio Miglior Nemico can more or less be summarized in one line ""working class = kind and warm, while upper-class = snob and devious. But love wins in the end"".<br /><br />Such a trite clichè for such a smart director.<br /><br />There isn't really too much to talk about in the movie. Every character is a walking stereotype: the self-made-man who forgets his roots but who'll become ""good"" again, the scorned wife, the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest-but-poor guy... Acting is barely average.<br /><br />Severely disappointing under every aspect.","The movie fails to live up to the director's past successes, resorting to shallow stereotypes and trite clichés that leave the characters feeling one-dimensional. The acting is only mediocre, resulting in a severely disappointing viewing experience."
What could have been improved in the film to make it more engaging and less disappointing to the audience?,"What the hell is in your minds ? This film sucks ! Each minute I was getting more and more bored. I strove to watch the end because I hope something at least would at last happen ! But instead of that, I got amazed how dull the end was treated... What is this story about this bloody ""bogeyman"" ? How comes he doesn't die ? He is a bloody human being for God's sake ! A mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago. Then what ? His stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal ? This film a fascinatingly stupid... It's a must of silliness. I'm gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film.","This film was incredibly boring and the storyline left much to be desired. The concept of the ""bogeyman"" was poorly developed and lacked any real substance. The lack of character development and the predictable plot twists made it feel like a waste of time. Overall, this movie was a major disappointment and not worth watching."
What are some criticisms of the movie Halloween?<br />,"Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made, Halloween does feature the memorable Michael Myers and some great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis.<br /><br />However, its rewatchability factor is very close to zero, as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness/culmination to the actual events.<br /><br />This is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all.<br /><br />How it spawned so many sequels, I will never comprehend.<br /><br />Thank God Rob Zombie is remaking this. And generally, I hate remakes.<br /><br />Surely he will more than compensate for all the random time-filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks.<br /><br />This is a movie we feel we have to like, much like the way we're taught that we SHOULD enjoy Dickens.<br /><br />Don't assume this is a classic.","The movie Halloween is often considered overrated in the horror genre, with a notable focus on dull and time-filling scenes leading to a lack of rewatchability. Despite featuring iconic character Michael Myers and strong acting by Jamie Lee Curtis, the film's pace and lack of engaging content make it hard to sit through without feeling bored. This lack of excitement and abundance of filler content make it a film that is not highly recommended for those seeking a thrilling viewing experience."
What did you think of the cinematography in the movie?,"Hahahaha!!!!!!Funny-that sums this movie up in one word.What the crap was this ""thing"",since It might kill me to use the word movie!?!?!I hope the director,writer,and producer didn't mean for this to turn out good,because it sure didn't!!!A scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark,and the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the island!!!Oh my Gooooooodddd!!!!I hate this film so much that when I was watching it I laughed at all the serious parts,because they were so corny and unprofessional....and they couldn't have made the shark look more unrealistic,even though this ""thing"" had a bit larger budget than most low-budget movies.All I have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad acting,and stupid corny dialogue,because if you are expecting a good movie you'll be highly disappointed.","This movie was an absolute disaster. The plot was ridiculous and the acting was laughably bad. The special effects were so unrealistic that it was hard to take the ""hammerhead shark"" seriously. It felt like the filmmakers didn't even try to make a decent movie. Watch it only if you want a good laugh at how terrible it is."
What makes this movie stand out in terms of humor?,This was a really funny movie.<br /><br />Every 1 in the movie was trying to be serious that is what made this movie so funny. I mean come on a shark's head on a human body. Can it get any funnier. Good job Sci-Fi keep the comedy movies coming. I never thought movies could get anymore retarded. If they keep it up they will have to rename the sci fie channel the comedy sci fi channel or something like that.<br /><br />I cant wait 4 the next blockbuster movie from sci fi.<br /><br />Ill be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and Ill be ready to laugh it up again!!!,"The humor in this movie was cringeworthy and forced, attempting to be funny with ridiculous scenes like a shark's head on a human body. The attempts at comedy fell flat, making the movie come across as trying too hard to be humorous. The excessive silliness made the film feel more like a parody than a genuine comedy, leaving a sense of disappointment rather than genuine amusement."
Would you recommend this movie to someone looking for a quality film with a meaningful story?,"A scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark. Well, who wouldn't? It's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called ""Paul"". Also, William Forsythe's cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility. On the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark Paul bites another one to death. As a matter of fact I find bad b-movies quite amusing. But for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less. Then it might have been fun.","The movie revolves around a scientist who turns his dead son into a hammerhead shark, leading to cheesy and unbelievable scenes. The character portrayed by William Forsythe lacks credibility, and the attempt at combining horror with humor falls flat. The low-budget production is evident throughout, diminishing the overall viewing experience. Overall, the film fails to deliver a compelling narrative or engaging characters, making it hard to recommend to those seeking a thought-provoking or well-made movie."
What aspects of the plot made this movie fall short of its potential?,"This type of plot really does have a lot of potential, but it was butchered here. Honestly, I sensed the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. Whoa, I was wrong! So mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's really bad. I should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but I most likely would have lost count.<br /><br />Pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks. I hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film.<br /><br />Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare...<br /><br />This is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick.","The plot of the movie had a lot of potential but ended up being a disappointment. The cheesy elements at the beginning hinted at a better development, but instead, it took a turn for the worse after the grotesque birthing scene. The storyline of a mad scientist creating a monster to show off to his friends before planning to kill them, only for them to escape, was poorly executed. The overuse of a rubber shark mask lurking in the background and the excessive spoon-feeding of horror elements, like the blood-dripping severed leg, made it hard to take the movie seriously. Additionally, the random inclusion of a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare in the midst of a jungle setting felt out of place and added to the disjointed nature of the film. Overall, this movie leaves much to be desired, and you may find yourself sympathizing more with the monster than the human characters."
What were some major flaws in the movie that disappointed the audience?,"This movie makes me think the others I've seen with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a ""b"" movie. The acting was so laughable that not even the memories of Combs' past campy triumphs were enough to save it. Considering the script I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am thoroughly upset that I paid Blockbuster prices for this trash. The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of. Avoid this movie no matter what.","The movie had an incredibly disjointed plot with numerous holes, making it seem like a low-budget B movie. The acting was so comically bad that even the presence of Combs couldn't salvage it. It appeared that the script lacked coherence and creativity, possibly due to budget constraints. Many viewers felt cheated paying a premium price for this subpar film, concluding that it should have come with a warning label."
What is the premise of this film and who are the main characters involved?,"Horror/Sci-Fi that is interesting as it is laughable. F/X pretty good...for what you manage to see. A made for TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughing and stammering in awe...Coombs' creation, by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead, is let loose to hunt down one by one his father's colleagues. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.","The movie tries to blend horror and sci-fi genres but fails to deliver a compelling storyline. The special effects are subpar, often leaving much to be desired. The plot feels over-the-top and laughable at times, making it hard to take the movie seriously. The performances from the cast, including Jeffrey Coombs as the scientist, feel mediocre and uninspired. Overall, ""Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy"" lacks depth and fails to captivate its audience."
"What were some shortcomings of the film ""Sorrows Lost""?","I caught ""Sorrows Lost"" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had some high hopes for this film. Sadly, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty lame. The bad lighting and camera work, along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality.<br /><br />Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the FX! You can't just get away with cool FX in shorts anymore, it's been 5 years since ""405"" made a big splash. At least that short quick, cool and was even a little funny! None of that can be said about ""Sorrows Lost.""","The story was deemed as pretty lame, the lighting and camera work were subpar, the editing and music were not great, and overall the film seemed low quality. The reviewer expressed disappointment in the emphasis placed on visual effects rather than having a strong storyline and good technical production."
What makes The Brain That Wouldn't Die a terrible film according to the reviewer?,"The Brain That Wouldn't Die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits. It's got all the classic signs of being bad: unbelieveable plotline, terrible acting, low-grade sets and lighting. The plotline goes like this: When a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident, she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab, where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive. I'll bet Virgnina Leath, who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table. Anyway, the doctor then tries to find her a new body, and hires two strippers so she can chose one to have her new body. Bad all the way through, so bad it was torn to pieces on Mystery Science Theater 3000.","The Brain That Wouldn't Die is described as an incredibly terrible movie filled with unbelievable storyline, bad acting, and low-quality production elements. The plot revolves around a doctor who keeps his decapitated fiancee's head alive and tries to find her a new body by hiring strippers. The film is so bad that it was even mocked on Mystery Science Theater 3000."
Did the unrealistic scenes and lack of police investigation detract from the overall believability of the movie?<br />,"Neat premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all. I loved how Bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all! Unfortunately, the same can't be said for his gal. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck.<br /><br />Lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper (still have nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand. I admit I was intrigued to see what the mysterious ""thing"" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HA HA HA!! The girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived. Personally, I really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that!","The movie had a neat premise but was very unrealistic. The lack of injury from a crazy speeding accident, the unexplained police negligence, and dragged out scenes like the plain stripper made it hard to take the movie seriously. The mysterious ""thing"" reveal was not scary but rather laughable, and the revival scene came off as more sadistic than emotional."
Would you recommend watching this movie on its own?,"A demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life. Honest this is the plot of the movie. He try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body. For some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin. The sleaze style of the movie is laughable. No one in the movie can actually act including the head. The closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak and the ending is so badly done. Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me folks I wouldn't watch this movie on its own.","The movie has a ridiculous plot where a scientist brings his decapitated girlfriend's head back to life and searches for a new body in the sleazy part of town. The acting is terrible, including the head itself, and the closet monster looks like a man with a mask tied on. The slow and weak plot leads to a badly done ending, making it a film best suited for watching with Mystery Science Theater 3000 for some comedic relief."
What are some specific aspects that contribute to the mediocrity of this movie?,"Another movie that relies upon the trite, worn-out cliché of the mad scientist gone madder. The movie centers around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead...back to life. I know, I know...you've never heard that one before! Of course, as all of these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniacal, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setup, you'd think that it'd be at least a bit suspenseful. Wrong. Like many movies of this era, the idea is nice, but the execution and the script is mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've seen (no, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake)...but not one of the gems, either.","The movie heavily relies on a tired and overused storyline of a mad scientist conducting experiments that go awry, with no new twists or fresh ideas added to make it interesting. The plot lacks suspense and fails to engage the audience, falling flat in execution and script. Overall, it comes across as just another forgettable horror film in a sea of similar mediocre offerings."
What makes this film rely heavily on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode for entertainment value?,"I bought this film on DVD so I could get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Thankfully, Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo are watchable, because the film itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story one can follow, and a few actors that can act, there isn't anything else. The movie was so boring, I have firmly confirmed that I will never watch it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As summarized above, however, it was better than the film featured in the MST3K episode that preceded it; Mitchell.",The movie lacks excitement and fails to hold the audience's interest on its own.
What makes this movie a poor choice for viewers seeking a horror film to enjoy?,"...but it'll make you wonder if we had any in the first place! This movie is just as bad as any of today's horrible horror. A man goes around ogling semi-clad ladies, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes, coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of ""blood."" The movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the movie is so badly done it's impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage. Aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister, this movie can't even get its own title straight-- the beginning credits say ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die,"" but the end credits list it as ""The Head That Wouldn't Die.""","This movie is a mess from start to finish. It fails to evoke any genuine shock or outrage due to its poorly executed attempt at portraying a disturbing concept. The over-the-top gore scenes come off as more comical than terrifying. The constant objectification of women by the main character adds a distasteful layer to the already shoddy plot. Additionally, the inconsistency with the movie's title further showcases the lack of attention to detail in the production. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable horror movie experience."
What are some major flaws in the film?,"This film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous.<br /><br />The film looks (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all -she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive; they failed here too (the make up is awful even for the late 50's, rather funny).<br /><br />The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer never materialized; he was really bad at both. Same goes to the actors, leading and supporting.<br /><br />""The Brain That Wouldn't Die""'s best achievement is its short running time.","This movie was a total disaster across different genres - sci-fi, horror, even comedy. The production quality was extremely low, the actors seemed clueless, and the script felt like it was being written on the spot. The addition of a monster in the closet to compensate for the lack of scares from the main character was a failed attempt, with sloppy makeup adding to the laughable aspects of the film. Director Joseph Green and the actors failed to deliver, making it clear why their careers never took off. The only positive thing about ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" is its short duration."
Can you believe this movie got a 1/10 rating?,"I just loved watching it though and having fun with it's total badness of a film. I saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you flip the to the other side of the DVD, they show the actual movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, folks this is grilled cheese.<br /><br />The acting, special effects, and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic. ""Doesn't she need lungs"" said Crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body, and Tom Servo just wistfully remarks ""No, she's got neck juice!"". The ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the ""cat fight"" between the two strippers. That ""Meow"" after the fight or scene, whatever, was classic. So, in some ways this was a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it. For a good time, watch the MSTK3 version, you'll get a great laugh.<br /><br />MST3K version: 10/10 The Brain that would die: 1/10","This movie is a straight-up disaster. The acting is cringeworthy, the special effects are laughably bad, and don't even get me started on the plot. It's so cheesy and unrealistic that you'll find yourself rolling your eyes more than actually being entertained. The whole concept of a talking head without a body is just plain ridiculous. And let's not forget about the so-called ""classic"" cat fight scene between the strippers - it was just plain tacky. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this cheesy mess of a film at all costs."
What was the main issue with Jason (Herb) Evers in the movie according to the reviewer?<br />,"I would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for Jason (Herb) Evers constant harping on experiment. Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overacting. Yet, as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his overacting is exactly that.<br /><br />Most of the actors in this B classic were rather good actors, minus Evers and the showgirls. If you watch this movie, you would have noticed Evers shouting almost every line, that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose. <br /><br />The special effects were par for the course in a B movie such as this one. In hindsight, there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.","Jason (Herb) Evers' constant overacting, particularly through shouting almost every line, was a major drawback in this film. Many viewers found his performance distracting and lacking subtlety compared to the other actors."
What are some common criticisms of Carlos Mencia's stand-up comedy style?,"Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing. If there's anybody who's insecure, it's a comedian who won't shut up about his audience.<br /><br />Then again, perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that he doesn't get off his free speech high horse. If you want to be funny, just make a joke, don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the American way with your failed attempts at generating laughter.<br /><br />Hmm... actually... the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor. Avoid this like the plague.","Critics argue that Carlos Mencia's jokes often come across as mean-spirited and rely heavily on insulting the audience rather than generating genuine laughter. Additionally, his constant need to explain his jokes and overly emphasize his commitment to free speech can detract from the comedic experience."
"What were your thoughts on the film ""House of Angels""? 
Negative","As a Turkish man now living in Sweden I must confess I often watch Scandinavian movies. Most if them I never understand. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a film called ""The Polish Wedding"" together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. Unfortunately I was wrong this movie "" House of Angels"" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the female so called star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so silly nobody can believe it.I think the whole thing is a mess from the start. lots of bad acting except from Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam","This movie was a total disaster. The acting was extremely poor, especially from the supposed female lead Helen Bergstrom. The plot was completely ridiculous and the whole film felt like a messy catastrophe. It's hard to believe that such a poorly made movie could even be released."
"What controversial elements are present in the movie ""Maslin Beach"" based on the positive review provided?","Scary.. Yes Scary!! Jam-packed with nudity (from fat people to skinny people), Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in S.A.<br /><br />I first saw this film two years ago - it's safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day. This film was horrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new-age characters staring down between a girls legs.<br /><br />Girl: You're not going to find God in there! Guy: Nah, But I think I found heaven.<br /><br />Steer clear of this one, unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting, adultery and the process of superlguing one's genitals together. AVOID!","The movie ""Maslin Beach"" is criticized for being filled with gratuitous nudity, deviating from being a romantic comedy and instead focusing solely on showcasing naked bodies. The film is described as horrible, amateurish, and inappropriate, touching on taboo subjects like farting, adultery, and genital mutilation - making it a film to steer clear of."
